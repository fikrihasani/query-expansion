For example, wemight find that a concept designated 'A' appears in some sub-set of thepapers.  Suppose further that we identify those papers in which concepts 'A'and 'B' are used together in the same papers in a certain specified manner.Clearly not all concepts will combine in a natural way, and not all authorscombining concepts 'A' and 'B' will do so in the same way, though somepredominant mode may emerge.  For a set of n concepts their structure isgiven by the totality of admissible combinations of concepts taken fromtwo to n at a time.  The frequency with which a given combination occursin the sample of papers on the topic is a measure of the degree of consensusregarding the particular concept combination within the corpus.  Forconcepts taken two at a time, the structure can be displayed as a graph withconcepts as nodes and the relations between them represented as lines (arcs)connecting the nodes.

       "  '  If this book has a central thesis, it rests upon the simple butfrequently neglected principle that college library service goesbeyond the commonly accepted functions of book circulation andstorage.  The college library exists, not merely to house andcirculate library materials, but to supplement and extend the teachingprocess with reference service, to afford faculty members libraryopportunities for improving instruction, and to encourage studentsto read more and better books.  Administration is essentially aservice activity, a tool through which library functions are morefully and efficiently realized.  The present work retains most of the material of the first edition,but includes substantial revision in each chapter.  The book wasplanned not only as a text in the teaching of college libraryadministration but also for independent professional reading.

Advances inLibrarianship is planned and designed to fill this need.  It willpresent critical articles and surveys based on the published literature,research in progress, and developments in libraries of all types.   Mechanization may appear to be the most obvious of the advancing frontsof librarianship, for automation has caught the enthusiastic support of alllibrarians who can visualize its potential.Advances in this field will certainly be found in every volume of this series.As the first group of articles in this volume demonstrate, technological changehas an obvious and direct implication for libraries, but the problem has beenfound to be much more complex than the simple inventory problem many expertsexpected.Advances in Librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities ofautomation, assessing where we are, where we are going, and how fast we can hopeto get there.\"The Machine and Cataloging\" reviews the current status of the machine-producedbook catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of MARC.Where business methods have greater applicability, progress is easier, asreported in \"Mechanization of Acquisition Processes.\"Even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in thefuture, not the past.One of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization ofcatalog information is that discussed in \"Filing Systems for ComputerManipulation.\"This detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggestspossible solutions.   For many years technical service costs have been defended without adequateknowledge of the facts.As automated procedures are proposed, standards are determining costs oftraditional operations become essential.The article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficultand reviews the significant advances of the past few years.   The school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services muchmore rapidly than other libraries, as reflected in its new name, theinstructional media center.Here, technical change, together with new teaching methods, has made possiblemajor developments in library service in schools as well as for children inthe public library.Two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated, and thatwhat remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception.   Bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow.   Articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerialplanning theory have for libraries.The articles on the application of these concepts, which come from research inadministration, are provocative and may appear controversial to some.   The article on library development in developing countries provides ananalysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting othercountries in providing the library service which is so important in the modernworld.',\n",

This, be it noted, is most evident infiercer social predators like wolves, where escape from the packis virtually impossible and where co-operation without fightingis necessary for survival; whereas in the non-social but proverbiallypeaceful dove prevention of escape leads to violent and oftenfatal attacks on the weaker mate.  In a final chapter he advances some suggestion as to how inthe human species, where evolution is primarily cultural, andnot guided by Darwinian selection in the strict sense, theaggressive drive may be canalized into less dangerous channels.Man has innumerable ways of adaptively ritualizing his behavior,many of them analogous, if not homologous, to those found inanimals.

However up until the forties the overwhelmingmajority of algebraists were investigating merely a few kinds of algebraicstructures.  These were primarily groups, rings and lattices.  The firstgeneral theoretical work dealing with arbitrary sets with arbitraryoperations is due to G. Birkhoff (1935).  During these same years, A.Tarski published an important paper in which he formulated the basicprinciples of a theory of sets equipped with a system of relations.  Suchsets are now called models.  In contrast to algebra, model theory madeabundant use of the apparatus of mathematical logic.  The possibility ofmaking fruitful use of logic not only to study universal algebras butalso the more classical parts of algebra such as group theory wasdiscovered by the author in 1936.  During the next twenty-five years, it gradually became clear that thetheory of universal algebras and model theory are very intimatelyrelated despite a certain difference in the nature of their problems.  Andit is therefore meaningful to speak of a single theory of algebraic systemsdealing with sets on which there is defined a series of operations andrelations (algebraic systems). The formal apparatus of the theory is thelanguage of the so-called applied predicate calculus.  Thus the theory canbe considered to border on logic and algebra.\",\n",

Although there seems to be little agreement on whatrelevance means, and some doubt that it is quantifiable,there is, nevertheless, a growing agreement that a fixedand formal relationship exists between the relevance andthe recall performance of any system.  Thus, we will findin the literature both a frankly subjective notion of relevance as reported by individual users, and equations,curves, and mathematical formulations which presumably providenumerical measures of the recall and relevancecharacteristics of information systems.  This phenomenonof shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjectiveand non-mathematical term to equations in which thesame term is given a mathematical value or a mathematicaldefinition has its ancient parallel in discussionsof probability.  One cannot, of course, legislate themeaning of a term.  It all depends, as Alice pointed out,on \"who is master,\" the user or the term.  On the other hand,the use of a single term in the same document to covertwo or more distinct meanings, especially when such ausage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrineby attributing to it mathematical validity which it doesnot have, represents a more serious situation than merelycareless ambiguity.',\n",

       "  \"   Analysis of the problems of defining the mutual relevancies of queries and document-collections indicates that they essentially involve the problem ofconceptual relatedness.. In order to consider the later problem, the question of concept-formation is first discussed, which in turn requires a definition ofconcept.. An extensional interpretation is suggested whereby a concept is associated with a class of conceptually-similar documents.. Users' similarity-judgments then provide the empirical data for formal definitions of concept andconceptual relatedness.. It is found, however, that certain very general difficulties rule out the possibility of defining concepts and their relatedness by the method proposed.. Since this method is based on human relevance-judgments, it seems a natural one to adopt, so that its collapse hasserious practical and theoretical consequences.. An alternative approach is therefore proposed whose elaboration will form Part II of this article..\",\n",

The method uses the last circulation date as a parameter of user circulation requirements.. The resulting stack collection would, by design,satisfy over 99 percent of the user circulation requirements and yet be ofminimum size.. Preliminary, but not yet fully validated research, indicates that the number of volumes in a library's holdings may be reduced by 60 to 70 percent and yet satisfy well over 99 percent of the user requirements.. It mayalso be possible to determine which books should have multiple copies in orderthat user disappointment can be minimized.. The effective result of this approach is that there now may be a quantitative method of maintaining the library's holdings at a reasonable level and, in addition, a reduction in the disappointment of the user who is unable to find the book he wants because of use by another..\",\n",

       "  '   The original aim of this study was to obtain objective data bearing on the much argued question of whether author indexing is \"good\".. Author indexing of285 documents reporting biomedical research was scored by comparing the author-supplied terms (author set) for each paper with a criterion set of terms that was  established by asking a group of 12 potential users to describe the samedocument.. Terms in the document title (title set) were scored similarly.. Theaverage author set contained almost half of all the terms employed by more than one member of the user group and scored 73% of the maximal possible score, as compared with 44% for the average title set.. When judged by the method and criterion employed here, author indexing is substantially better than indexing derived from document titles.. The findings suggest that indicia supplied by anauthor should serve scientists in biomedical disciplines other than his own about as well as they serve his disciplinary colleagues.. The general methoddeveloped for measuring indexing quality may represent a practical yardstick of wide applicability..',\n",

Its advantages are: (1) it provides  a single index of the property it attempts to measure; (2) it allowsfor gradations of retrieval status, through the mathematical concept of a \"weak ordering\"; (3) it evaluates retrieval performance relative to random searching;and (4) it takes into account the amount of relevant material desired by the requester..',\n",

As an application of this principle to the search of pertinent items in a literature file, the file itemsshould be arranged in decreasing order of the probability that an item will yield the information sought.. Complete ordering in this manner may not befeasible, and it is proposed that the files be partially ordered in search zones with some loss in search efficiency.. A model for assessing the relativeefficiency for partial ordering is developed and used to determine optimal zone sizes under an assumed target distribution pattern.. In this way, trade-offbetween file organization effort and search effort can be meaningfully evaluated.. A representative target distribution function for search literature appears to follow the Bradford law of scattering.. This function is used to demonstrate the application of the model over a meaningful range of parameters obtained from empirical studies.. It is shown that a good two-zone search planto scientific literature is one in which 15-20% of the most useful documents are examined first.. Only about one of three searches should have to go on to a search over the remainder of the file..',\n",

Articles of eyeresearch interest are found in a wide variety of journals, but a small numberof journals carry a large proportion of the articles judged valuable by the eyeresearchers.. Approximately a fourth of eye research articles are in foreign languages.. Translations are not readily available.. Despite a delay of more than 15 month between the original appearance of article in journals and the mailing of photocopies, about half of the articles of interest to the researchers were not known to them previously.. For extensive retrospectivesearches more than one secondary service must be used..

This paper considers the ISRS as a subsystem within a larger system which includes the users and the funders of the retrieval system.. The three components form a closed-loop information feedback system in which user response influences both the funding and operation of the ISRS as it attempts to satisfy user needs within a finite budget allocation.. Reward-cost theory provides the basis fordescribing user behavior.. An industrial dynamics model has been developed to simulate ISRS/user/funder behavior where a university departmental library is the ISRS component..

       "  '   (I) Better understanding of subject document retrieval might result if different functions of subject document retrieval system are studied separately.. This paper is concerned with retrieval of documents, in response to a question, from which answers to that question can be inferred (\"answer-providing documents\").. \"Answer can be inferred from document\" has many possible meanings, one of which must be selected (an \"inference specification\").. Inasmuch as scientists in a field disagree about the correctness of inferences, have somewhat different background knowledge, etc., any inference specification can only approximate scientific inference practices.. Two sources of systematic knowledge of document-statement inference practices in a scientific field are described.. (II) If a content word occurs in a question, then it occurs in any answer to that question (with some apparently tractable exceptions).. An indexing procedure based on that fact isdescribed which would permit retrieval of all answer-providing documents for a question.. However, because the indexing is \"nonrelational\", it could cause false retrievals as well.. Various ways of dealing with such false retrievals are   briefly indicated, and a study is sketched that would provide data for helping selection among them.. Two special point concerning indexing for retrieval of answer-providing documents are discussed separately..',\n",

The effect of word frequency and other parameters on the association process is investigated through examinationof related pairs and through retrieval experiments.. Associated pairs of wordsusually reflect localized word meanings, and true synonyms cannot readily befound from first or second order relationships in our document collections.. There is little overlap between word relationships found through associations and those used in thesaurus construction, and the effects of word associations and a thesaurus in retrieval are independent.. The use of associations in retrieval experiments improves not only recall, by permitting new matches between requests and documents, but also precision, by reinforcing existing matches.. In our experiments, the precision effect is responsible for most of the improvement possible with associations..

       "  \"   The purpose of this paper is to describe a research project conducted at a technical center to test the hypothesis that: A theoretically-sound managerial cost-accounting system can be designed to meet the specific characteristics of a technical information center by revising and innovating systems utilized by other enterprises.. A computerized cost system was developed and operated fora three-month period to test this hypothesis.. The results of the study indicate that effective managerial cost accounting is possible for a technicalinformation center.. Relevant cost information was generated periodically to measure the operating performance of the center's production process..

Foreach pattern, journals were ranked by frequency of use and a scatter diagram was drawn..   Patterns I and II largely resembled patterns obtained by counting citationsin basic journals or by counting publications of selected researchers.. Pattern III was more widely scattered..  It is concluded that access to diverse journals is needed by researchers to supply new ideas, and that this diversity of reading is not reflected adequately by citation counting or other indirect means..   Current Contents, used by the author for current-awareness purposes in building his card file, generated 88% of all articles.. Scatter diagrams indicated the decreased scatter predicted from its use..   The 30% most important journals in this collection, including about 80% oftitles, are ranked for each pattern..',\n",

       "  '   When adding a document to a collection, an indexer should choose a representation which makes evident both the content of the document and its relation to other documents already in the collection.. Toward this end, the Negotiated Search Facility (NSF) makes possible indexer-controlled retrieval of information from a collection data base using tools beyond those available in atraditional bibliographic catalog.. The design philosophy of NSF is to offer a framework to guide the indexer while allowing him freedom to retrieve any data which he judges will help him make indexing decisions.. An example which indicates how an indexer might use the facility also shows how the displayformats and command language promote interaction.. While the discussion is directed toward indexing, it should be clear that the facility would be equallyuseful to the searcher..',\n",

Each statisticalcriterion was compared with the performance of human indexers by the use of rankcorrelation statistics.. The simple word count was found to be superior to theother four previously suggested criteria - all of which made use of the in-corpus relative occurrence frequency.. The test were conducted over 19documents dealing with the subject of Information Science, a total of over 66,000 word occurrences..

       "  '   It is often assumed that the amount of interindexer consistency experienced under a given method of indexing is somehow indicative of the quality of the indexing.. To explore this assumption, two hypotheses are stated concerning the possible connection between interindexer consistency and indexing quality.. Aspecific counter-example is then exhibited which shows both hypotheses to beinvalid.. Although a mathematical analysis of the counterexample yields certaininsights, the general relationship between interindexer consistency and successful retrieval is more subtle than might have been expected..

This paper elaborates on this model and indicates the range of its applicability.. Several fundamental quantities are defined specifically in a way which allows for quantification.. It is pointed out in this paper that this model can be the basis for the development of a \"true\" science of information with all of the necessary requirements for a science.. By the use of this model and the definition of a \"true\" science, the goals and requirements for a curriculum in information science are thus established..

Interviews with Nobel laureates and comparisons of their name-order practices to those of other scientists suggest that this symbol is ambiguous and makes evaluation of individual role-performance difficult.. A probability model of expected distribution of name orders is used in measuring preferences for particular sequences, and these preferences vary with the authors' eminence.. On the assumptions that authors' names are listed in order of the value of their contributions, laureates should be first-authors more often than other scientists; in fact, they are not.. Instead, they exercise their noblesse oblige by giving credit to less eminent co-workers increasingly as their eminence grows.. They do so more often after the prize, and eminent laureates-to-be forego first-authorship more often than  those as yet unrecognized..

       "  \"  The Matthew Effect occurs when scientists receive differential recognitionfor a particular scientific contribution depending on theirlocation in the stratification system.  Merton originally introducedthe concept to explain the allocation of credit among authors ofmultiple discoveries or collaborators.  In this paper the concept isgeneralized to apply to all scientific work.  If the Matthew Effectwere to operate, the reception of papers of equal quality should beinfluenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system.To test this hypothesis, data are drawn from several studies ofsimilar design.  In each study we control for the number of citationspapers received at time 2.  This enables us to look at groups ofpapers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2.We then see whether there were any differences in the reception ofthese papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the author'slocation in the stratification system.  All the data indicatethat assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more important determinant of a paper's initial reception than any of the stratificationvariables.  However, the speed of diffusion of papers of equal qualityis influenced by the reputation of the author based on past workthat is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery.  TheMatthew Effect also operates for those scientists located at prestigiouspoints of the social system of science.  All other stratificationvariables, including eminence as measured by receipt of awardsdid not influence the speed of diffusion.  Data are presented thatindicate that top papers written by high-ranking scientists are no more likely to be widely diffused early than are top papers by low-ranking scientists.  The Matthew Effect also serves to focusattention on the work of little-known men who collaborate withscientists of high repute and to increase retroactively the visibilityof the early work of scientists who go on to greater fame.

In classical librarianship noeffort can be made to personalize the listing of titles or arrangement ofvolumes for an individual user.  A user is unidentified, and, except forthat small fraction of a percent who consult reference librarians, users remain nameless.  The computer, however, with its superb ability to treat users asindividual persons and events as individual events, possesses the potentialfor enabling big libraries to recapture the human qualities ofwhich classical librarianship has deprived them since their days asone-librarian libraries.  However, rehumanization is not the onlycontribution computerization will make to libraries.  Developments in modern society are forcing libraries to establish newobjectives.  Contemporary living is information based, a phenomenonthat is outmoding the venerable concept of library function.  As small speciallibraries already do, all libraries must participate in the culturalactivities of the individuals in their communities rather thanmerely make available a torpid \"service.\" Libraries must look forward tosupplying information to a user when and where he needs it - anobjective impossible to attain with classical library techniques.',\n",

Thisform of foreign aid, either government sponsored or privatelysupported, is a twentieth century phenomenon.  The broaderconcept, foreign aid or foreign assistance, means providing another country with any kind of goods, whether financial,commodity, or manpower, to almost any purpose, andextends to antiquity.  Technical assistance, which may bedefined, on the other hand, as the supplying of techniques,is an outgrowth of the industrial revolution and parallelsAmerica's rise in the nineteenth century to world recognitionas an important industrial and trade power.  Government useof such aid as an instrument of foreign policy, as well asthe integration of these private and public efforts in the foreignassistance field, began to develop under President Roosevelt'sGood Neighbor Policy.

For some time past, the attention of sociologists and social psychologists studying communication processes, once focused on so-called mass phenomenaand mass publics, has turned to the interplay of communication processes with more and more definitely delineated and mapped aspects of social structure.  One aspect of this shift in interest has been the increasing attention paid by behavioral scientists to the systems supplying information of a specialized sort, and to the publics which are consumers of this specialized information.

Quality of output is more significant than quantity in elicitingrecognition through the receipt of awards, appointment to prestigious academicdepartments, and being widely known to one's colleagues..

Using data obtained from printed sources and questionnairesmailed to university physicists, the conditions making for high visibility of ascientists\\' work are studied.. Four strong determinates of visibility werefound: the quality of work, as measured by citations; the honorific awards received for work in physics; the prestige of the physics department to whichthe scientist belong; and speciality.. Quantity of output, age, and name-ordering patterns on collaborative papers have no independent effect on visibility.. Just as some physicists may be easily seen (i.e., have high visibility), other are in positions where they may easily see.. This lattercharacteristic is called \"awareness\"..The data indicate that awareness is high in all sectors of the population studied.. Variables such as age, rank of department, and quality of work made for only minor differences in awareness.. We conclude that the communication system in physics operates efficiently..',\n",

       "  'The Problem of assessing the \"quality\" of scientificpublications has long been a major impediment toprogress in the sociology of science.  Most researchershave typically paid homage to the belief that quantity ofoutput is not the equivalent of quality and have then goneahead and used publication counts anyway (Coler, 1963;Crane, 1965; Price, 1963; Wilson, 1964).  There seemedto be no practicable way to measure the quality of largenumbers of papers or the life\\'s work of large numbers ofscientists.  The invention of the Science Citation Index(SCI) a few years ago provides a new and reliable toolto measure the significance of individual scientists\\'contributions.  Starting in 1961, the SCI has listed allbibliographic references appearing in an increasingly largenumber of journals.  The number of citations anindividual receives may be tabulated and used as an indicatorof the relative scientific significance or \"quality\" of thatindividual\\'s publications.',\n",

       "  \"  In spite of concerns expressed in the literature aboutthe health and vigor of the field of information science andof its service-oriented institutions - libraries and informationcenters - the progress reviews in this volume provide grounds foroptimism.  Some of the trends that were commented on in Volume 6have proved to be solid and important.  For example, the movementtoward rapid interactive access to major public and commercial data bases is not very strong, and it will probably not be many years beforesatisfying experience with this new mode of information access willhelp it become not merely an experimental innovation but thestandard means of searching and using centrally (or regionally)held data.  Three chapters in this volume touch on related aspects of the movement: Bennett's review of the user interface in interactivesystems, Gechman's report on machine-readable bibliographic data bases, andBrandhorst and Eckert's review of document retrieval and disseminationsystems.  This volume also introduces a new Annual Review topic of potentiallygreat importance for future libraries: video cartridges and cassettes.It is widely accepted that libraries and information centers will, inthe coming years, shift the balance of their holdings in the direction ofsome of the newer media, and the chapter by Kletter and Hudson helps to define the potential and problems of some of the promising new media.  Other newareas of interest are information system applications in the criminaljustice system and information system applications in the humanities.  In addition to these topics, this volume covers three of the core areasof information science, which we attempt to review on as close to anannual basis as possible: information needs and uses, document descriptionand representation, and organization of information.  Thiscoverage is consistent with a newly developed Annual Review masterplan for cyclic but flexible coverage of some 40 major areas of interestin library and information science.\",\n",

       "  '  The major trends of the 1970\\'s in information system planning andservices are becoming clear, as indicated in this year\\'s Annual Reviewchapters.  The movement toward inter-institutional operations, or networking,began gaining force in the 1965-1970 period, through the establishmentof many new library consortia, and there were some tentative effortsto use computers for nationwide bibliographic information \"utilities.\"These movements are now more vigorous and are showing signs of beingcost-effective, productive ventures.  Inter-institutional cooperation not onlypromises service improvements and cost reductions, but also poses newproblems and demands.  Formalized cooperation among different institutionsrequires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importanceto a clear understanding of the information needs of specific usersubgroups.  It also requires more careful and productive system planningand design, including intelligent consideration of the \"make versus buy\"issue.  Several chapters in this volume touch on these problems andconsiderations.  One of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growthin the use of on-line information retrieval services - both those operatedby the federal government and those operated by the private sector.  Theapparent cost-effectiveness of these services is raising some of the sameproblems for data base producers that inter-institutional cooperation amonglibrary and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printedmaterials: namely, how to cover rising costs in the face of declining (or lessrapidly growing) sales of individual units of the product - monographs,serials, secondary information publications, or magnetic tapes.  Theinclusion of a chapter on copyright - the first in the Annual Review series -reflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over theownership and distribution of information.  Another aspect of thatcontroversy - the role of government and non-profit information servicesin relation to those of private industry - is explored in this year\\'schapter on document retrieval systems and techniques.',\n",

       "  '  The co-joining of \"design\" with \"evaluation\" that is called for by thischapter posed organizational and inclusion-exclusion problems for theauthor.  In part, \"design\" and \"evaluation\" prescribe two separate setsof activities, the former pertaining to the planning, development, andtesting of new information system structures and modification of existingstructures, the latter to appraisals and assessments of operationalsystems and system components.  However, \"design\" includes not only theformulation of goals and objectives for systems but also provisions forevaluation in accordance with expectations.  \"Evaluation\" applies totesting design concepts and to trying out preliminary implementationsfor the purpose of improving initial designs, as well as to theappraisal of operating systems.  Appraisals at any stage of systemoperability may yield data that indicate the need for system modificationsthat require redesign and assessment.  Thus, portions of \"design\" and\"evaluation\" are closely interrelated, as Katter demonstrated inhis 1969 review.  \"Design\" and \"evaluation\" may be examined methodologically or withrespect to outcomes of the application of methodologies.  Increasingly,designers and evaluators have been acknowledging the dependence ofoutcomes on sound procedural conceptualizations.

       "  \"  This chapter continues the coverage of the generation and use ofmachine-readable data bases inaugurated in Volume 9 by Williams (178).  Itis therefore an update consisting primarily of 1974 material and is preparedin general accordance with Williams's initial compilation.  The same definition of data bases and the boundaries of their applicationsused in Volume 9 are continued this year.  A data base is consideredto be an organized collection of machine-readable records containingbibliographic and/or document-related data (e.g., index information).The data bases that we will consider are used for information storageand retrieval and/or research in information storage and retrieval ordata base generation.  The choice of these constraints precludes coverage of several areas.  First,data bases primarily concerned with numerical or other nonbibliographicinformation, such as chemical structures, (Milen et al., 112) are excluded.Thus, even though the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Numberis a data element common to many bibliographic data bases, papers such asthat by CAS regarding progress in building the Registry System itself (39)are excluded.  Similarly, though some textual and bibliographic materialis included in the Systems Consultants, Inc report (156) to the Navy, mostof the information retrieval is concerned with miniaturized hardware in ashipboard environment and thus is not considered within the scope of thischapter.  Finally, though many of the data bases are used for generationof publications via phototypesetting, we are not considering that productionoperation.\",\n",

This field, which will be referred to as \"InformationScience and Technology,\" draws on fragments and fringes of a numberof sciences, technologies, disciplines, arts, and practices.  The elementthat provides whatever degree of cohesiveness now exists in the field is ashared deep concern with \"information\" - its generation, transformation,communication, storage, retrieval, and use.  Because of the universality of information processes, and also becauseof the variety of backgrounds of those concerned with them, there is verylittle agreement about the boundaries of Information Science and Technology,or about its parentage, its essential nature, or its future.  To put itsimply, at the present time there is no clearly defined and well-understoodfield of Information Science and Technology.  There is not, truth to tell,even clear agreement on what the word \"information\" itself means andparticularly on whether it implies a creative act of the intellect or acommodity that can be embodied in documents, transported, and exchanged.Distressing as this ambiguity and lack of agreement may be, they neednot and do no preclude a constructive review of topics of current interestto users, designers, and students of information systems and services.The purpose of the ADI Annual Review series, initiated in this volume,is to provide such a review.',\n",

Besides, thesematters can be of great significance to the behavioral scientist interestedin human organization and communication.  While \"user studies\" havenot yet gone very far in serving either of these functions, the end of 1963seems to have been something of a take-off point for empirical researchon the information needs and uses of scientists and technologists.  Forthis first volume of the Annual Review, we shall therefore cover studies thatmade their appearance as far back as the last month of 1963, to give thereader a rounded picture of a period during which this area of researchhas witnessed progress along the following lines:    Substantial advances in the more systematic and fruitful application  of a technique (critical incidents) that had made its appearance in  this field earlier in less rigorous forms;    The introduction of at least two very promising approaches (solution  development records; comparison of research teams working on identical  tasks) quite different from any that had been applied to this field before;   and    An increase in the number of efforts at comprehensive study of the  information-flow situation in given disciplines, one of which [American  Psychological Association (3)] has become the model and envy of research  in this area.',\n",

Like its two predecessors, this volume attempts to describe andevaluate the most significant work that has been reported in the fieldduring the past year, with the ultimate aim of improving both our standardsand our means of professional communication.  The field of information science and technology continues to evolve andgrow.  As it does, new areas of interest emerge and established areas ofinterest change in importance.  Accordingly, our pattern of coveragechanges.  The single chapter on Automation in Libraries and InformationCenters, in Volume 2, has been expanded into two chapters, one covering automation of technical processes and the other covering documentnetworks, and a new chapter has been added on information systemapplications in education.  Such applications are important not just becausethey involve, in part, libraries and other information facilities butbecause they highlight innovative ideas and techniques that should be ofvalue to anyone interested in the total communication process.   At the same time, \"core\" chapters of the review are continued:  informationneeds and uses; content analysis, specification, and control; file organizationand search; publication and distribution techniques; automated languageprocessing; man-machine communication; information system design and evaluation;and professional aspects of information science.These topics are of continuing and vital interest to our readers, and theirannual literature is significant, large, and growing.',\n",

Also,the topics of document dissemination and the secondary services, usuallycovered in parts of other chapters, have full and separate chapters thisyear.  Another change, made in response to suggestions from readers for bettersignposts within each volume, is the division of the book into severalmajor segments, each introduced by a short description of the contents ofthe section, the relationships among the chapters within it, and, in someinstances, one or two highlights of the year's technical progress.\",\n",

The increasing interest inand movement toward library networks and other cooperative,technology-supported information activities have helped to focusspecial attention not only on data processing and microfilm technology,the two traditional mainstays of library and document-handling systems,but also on the rapidly developing capabilities in modern tele-communications.Thus, a chapter on communication technology has appeared, for the firsttime, to bring readers up to date on changes in the communications industrythat have had or will have a great impact on how we design and useinformation-handling systems.  Two other first-time chapters cover management information systemsand information systems in state and local government.  Whilethe intent behind the development of such systems, and the kinds ofservices they provide, is peripheral to the purposes and services oflibrary and document-handling systems, one often sees in these peripheralareas some information parallels.  Indeed, one of the reasons for theAnnual Review's covering one or more of these areas each year is tohelp its readers exploit more fully the thinking and the problem-solvingtechniques they are fostering.\",\n",

With social memory, preserved and controlledby archives and libraries, a society is able to evolve to whatever future itis destined to experience in an ever-changing environment.  Archives were the forerunners of libraries.  The ancient archivescontained the best of society's accumulated knowledge; and as nationsgrew in wealth and security, archives and libraries become symbols of acountry's aspiration to create a better society.  Today, archives andlibraries are necessities.  These cultural institutions pass information tosucceeding generations in a variety of forms of distributable media.  In thisway, archives and libraries preserve the memory of civilization and passthis memory on to living individuals.

For sometime we have also been subscribing to the Automatic Subject CitationAlert (ASCA), which is produced by the Institute for ScientificInformation as a by-product of the Science Citation Index.  Thesethree sources differ in their scope and methods, but share thesame ultimate objective of providing a computer-based currentawareness service.  CT covers journals in all branches of chemistry, but provides onlyauthors and titles, the latter translated into American and edited by breaking down complex words so that word fragments can be retrieved.CBAC covers only papers on the interaction of chemical compounds withbiological systems, but provides abstracts which are available forcomputer search.  The computer can also search for molecularformulae and for Chemical Abstracts registry numbers of allcompounds included in the abstracts.  ASCA in its original formwas based on citations: the search profile can consist of a list ofreferences to older work, and the output is then a list of new papersciting this work.  Last spring ASCA introduced a 'term search', whichis a search for words in the titles of current papers and is thereforeanalogous to a CT search.

       "  \"  This review has been sponsored by the Office for Scientificand Technical Information and the end product of the completeresearch will be a thesaurus of management terms.  Parallel researchin the business management area and also supported by OSTI is being conducted by David Dews, Librarian of the Manchester Business School,and K.D.C. Vernon, Librarian of the London Graduate School ofBusiness Studies.  As Mr. Vernon is at present engaged in theconstruction of a faceted classification scheme for management,this investigation has concentrated on the possibility of utilizingfaceted techniques to construct such a thesaurus.  A study of existing information retrieval systems in themanagement field has already been made, so a decision to adoptsome form of post-co-ordinate indexing was assumed.  Thus a comparativestudy of other systems will not be attempted.  A decision has alsoalready been made that a controlled vocabulary, i.e. a thesaurus,was eventually going to be developed despite the latest Cranfieldresults that appear to provide evidence of the superiority ofnatural language over controlled vocabularies.  This was primarilybecause these results were restricted to tests on an aeronauticalcollection, and it may well be that the natural language of thisdiscipline is in itself a fairly controlled one, which iscertainly not the case with the rather 'soft' language ofmanagement.  This is borne out to some extent by Halkin, whoquotes relevance figures for coordinate indexing applied to organicchemistry (55 percent), engineering (35 percent), and socialscience (20 per cent).  Machine methods of term generation as described by Ovchinnikov,Mastermann and Luhn will not be considered, as there is no equipmentavailable to prepare thesauri on the lines these authors suggest.\",\n",

Thompson & Company accepted a contract with thePicatinny Arsenal, US Department of the Army, to perform a study aimedat developing 'Criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of libraryoperations and services' under the ATLIS Program (Army TechnicalLibrary Improvement Studies).  The study was divided into threephases aimed at:    I A Literature search to reflect the current 'state-of-the      art' covering library standards and the methods of evaluating      libraries developed up to the present.   II A phase in which to gather and evaluate any data required from      Army Technical Libraries, from available surveys already      published, or from any other sources, by which to develop      criteria.  III A phase in which to establish and validate the criteria.  Phases I and II of the study are now complete.  Phase III is in progressand is expected to be completed by the late fall of 1968.  The reports ofPhases I and II are already available for detailed study and that ofPhase III will be available soon.  The purpose of this paper is to presentsome of the findings of the study.\",\n",

A literature search recently conducted by the Department (R.Reynolds) has revealed a scarcity of usable information on this subject:such data as is available is difficult to evaluate comparatively becauseof the differing definitions of the operations costed and of the terms used todescribe them.  It would seem, therefore, that a first step towards developinga costing method of widespread application would be the establishment ofstandard conventions for the analysis of information systems.  One might postulate two possible ways of arriving at comparative costs forthese systems, namely:(a) General survey method:  The overall costs of a large number of information    systems are broken down into a small number of categories, and analysed    for correlation (see, for example, C.J. Wessel et al).(b) In-depth study:  A small number of systems are studied in detail in an    attempt to establish the true sources of the costs and factors affecting    them.  In a current project, we are attempting to apply method (b) to the productionof current-awareness bulletins.  An outline of some of the preliminary work inthis project follows.',\n",

In such research, and really in any good research, one shouldnot be collecting data haphazardly.  One must isolate and define a problem and,as far as possible, control other conditions so that interfering factors areeliminated.  Preferably one will narrow down the problem to manageableproportions.  It is then essential to approach the problem with some sort ofhypothesis or theory of the situation, and to concentrate on obtainingevidence for or against that hypothesis.  The important task is to devise just that crucial experiment which will give the answer as efficiently as possible.If the answer disproves the hypothesis, one has at least further evidence uponwhich to construct a different hypothesis; if it confirms the hypothesis, oneis ready for a further step forward, and so on.  Research is easier in afully controlled and reproducible situation; in a biological or humansituation one must often have recourse to statistical methods, but this doesnot alter the general methodology.  On the whole, I find a clear methodologylacking in much that is being done in the field of information science today.\",\n",

This was published in the Journal of Documentation in September 1965 and in his paper he looks at a limited numberof British use studies and draws some broad general conclusions relating to thedevelopment of a national information service.  The present paper which coversthe literature back to the beginning of 1966 is somewhat more detailed.  Itconsiders a wide range of investigations into the information gathering habits of scientists, engineers, social scientists and others, and reports results which it is hoped will provide managers with information on which to developpolicies regarding library and information services at all levels.  Althoughan increasing number of studies is being carried out in Eastern Europe andin the USSR there has been no major work reported and consequently the reviewconsiders mainly British and American investigations.\",\n",

       "  \"  When INFROSS began in the autumn of 1967, although a large number ofstudies had been conducted into the requirements of scientists for information,very little had been done in the field of social science information.  There are a number of possible reasons for this.  Social scientists, faced with a much smaller total volume of information, were much less information-conscious andless inclined to seek for solutions.  There are very few specialist librariesin the social sciences, and few librarians were therefore confronted withsocial scientists' information needs in the same way as librarians in scientific libraries were confronted with users and their problems.  Finally,until OSTI came along there was little in the way of funds to support thiskind of research.  This almost total absence of previous research had itsdisadvantages and advantages.  There were very few clues to guide us, and wewere therefore working to a certain extent in the dark.  On the other hand,we had a clean and open field uncorrupted by confusing and non-comparablestudies.  There is something to be said for being one of the first in a field.\",\n",

If the order in a system cannot keep pace with the increasingrequirements, its working capability will continuously decrease, becausethe searcher is becoming more and more overburdened in relation to hisavailable search time, search patience, and search memory.  The degree oforder attainable in a growing literature collection can be estimated on thebasis of six postulates.  The better the requirements imposed by thesepostulates are approximated in a practical documentation system, the higherare its working capability and life expectancy, but the expenditure to bemade on the literature analyses must also inevitably be higher.

In 1967, Olaf Helmer, then Senior Mathematician at the Randcorporation, forecast that scientists and engineers would increase fromfive million, in 1967, to twenty-five million by the year 2000 and theirtotal productivity would go up by a factor of ten.  He declined to assessthe associated growth of, and need for, scientific information but merelystated that there would be substantial changes in the way in which sciencewould actually be transacted.  It is these 'substantial changes' that concernthe publisher, editor, information scientist and librarian, because if wedo not anticipate - or at least keep pace with these changes - then we willnot be able to meet the information needs of our readers and we will becomeredundant.  Scientific information is a growing industry and it would beironic if we could not survive amid an abundance of information.  I regardthe chance to do something about the flow of information as a response to opportunity, not as an act of desperation.  The big problem is to sort outwhat is pertinent among this information and, in this world of rapid change,select and develop the technological devices that will match the needs ofthe scientist to this mass of information.\",\n",

       "  '  The idea that a language is based on a system of rules determiningthe interpretation of its infinitely many sentences is byno means novel.  Well over a century ago, it was expressed with reasonable clarity by Wilhelm von Humboldt in his famous butrarely studied introduction to general linguistics (Humboldt,1836).  His view that a language \"makes infinite use of finitemeans\" and that its grammar must describe the processes thatmake this possible is, furthermore, a outgrowth of a persistentconcern, within rationalistic philosophy of language and mind,with this \"creative\" aspect of language use (for discussion, seeChomsky, 1964, forthcoming).  What is more, it seems that evenPanini\\'s grammar can be interpreted as a fragment of such a\"generative grammar,\" in essentially the contemporary sense ofthis term.  This monograph is an exploratory study of various problemsthat have arisen in the course of work on transformational grammar,which is presupposed throughout as a general framework for thediscussion.  What is at issue here is precisely how thistheory should be formulated.  This study deals, then, withquestions that are at the border of research in transformationalgrammar.  For some, definite answers will be proposed; but moreoften the discussion will merely raise issues and consider possibleapproaches to them without reaching any definite conclusions.',\n",

       "  '  This is a book about social discrimination.  But its purpose is notsimply to add a few more empirical findings to an already extensive bodyof information.  The central theme of the work is a relatively newconcept - the rise of an \"anthropological\" species we call theauthoritarian type of man.  In contrast to the bigot of the older stylehe seems to combine the ideas and skills which are typical of a highly industrialized society with irrational or anti-rational beliefs.  He is at the same time enlightened and superstitious, proudto be an individualist and in constant fear of not being like all the others,jealous of his independence and inclined to submit blindly to powerand authority.  The character structure which comprises these conflictingtrends has already attracted the attention of modern philosophers andpolitical thinkers.  This book approaches the problem with the means ofsocio-psychological research.',\n",

       "  '  The idea for Automated Language Processing was suggested in 1964 at atime when the research efforts in information storage and retrieval wereexpanding at System Development Corporation.  Many people in the companywere directly interested in this area, and an even larger group had intereststhat were tangentially related.  A quick and effective means of acquaintingthem with the state-of-the-art was needed, but no convenient compilationof relevant material was available.  It was agreed that a book on thetheory and techniques of information storage and retrieval procedures wouldbe a worthwhile project for the language processing staff to undertake.Although no one member could reasonably be expected to cover the entirerange of technical developments in this field, the staff as a whole isconcerned with most phases of the work.  This is attested by the fact thatall but one of the chapter authors were connected with SDC either asemployees or consultants.  The single exception is Pendergraft, for SDChas had no sustained project in machine translation.  SDC Management wasenthusiastic in its support of the new project.',\n",

For instance in Chapter 1, it is assumedthat the reader is familiar with the idea of using keywords in informationretrieval: I have not considered the relation between this kind ofretrieval device and a controlled thesaurus or descriptor set, or thatbetween the use of simple class lists as document descriptions and theuse of descriptions with a syntactic structure, for example.  Equally,in Chapter 2, I have made use of recall/precision ratios as a means ofcharacterising retrieval performance, without justification or argument;but this does not mean that I am unaware of the difficulties of doing this,or of the attention which has been devoted to, and controversy which hasraged round, this subject; it is simply that from the point of view ofmy main purpose it is reasonable to use these ratios.',\n",

Automationcan also be extended to cover some more complicated functions.  Inall of these cases, the results supplied by automatic devices areanalysed and decisions are taken usually by man.  Thus, the role ofmachine is to considerably extend man's capabilities rather than tocompletely replace man.   The automated systems intended to accumulate and search for informationhave come to be called information-retrieval systems (IRS).  Thesesystems can also perform the simpler forms of data processing.The physical facilities of these systems are communications equipment,punched-card computers, microfilming equipment, and electronic computers,the latter playing the most prominent part. \",\n",

Forty-eight medical school head librarians signed thepetition indicating their approval, and a committee for this purpose was formed by Dr. Vilma Proctor, Chairman of the Medical School Libraries Group ofthe Medical Library Association.  This committee, composed of Mr. Truelson, Dr.Proctor, and myself,studied the questionnaires already in use, such as that of the U.S. Officeof Education.  These were rejected as not meeting the needs of ourspecialized group of libraries.  As a guide for selecting the terminologyin the questionnaire, we used the American Library Association's Definitionsfor Library Statistics; a Preliminary Draft (Chicago, 1961).  After several drafts, a sample questionnaire was approved by thecommittee and distributed to all the medical school libraries in the UnitedStates and Canada.

The interviewer obtained answers from the investigator to aquestionnaire to discover how the investigator had learned of a book, if thebook had been useful, and, if useful, how it had been used.. During the six-month study period, 30.4 percent of researchers' volumes returned weremonographs.. Almost four-fifths of books borrowed supplied information wanted,and about four-fifths of books used had been printed in the previous decade..Nine-tenths of the use of books was research-related, the other tenth beingfor lecture preparation..\",\n",

Survey items dealt with education, sex, age, salary,job mobility and preference for continuing education programs..   Some 60 percent of the respondents were professionals; 40 percent werenonprofessionals.. Seven hundred and twenty-eight chief librarians were identified in the population: 57 percent were professional librarians whilethe remainder were without a graduate library degree.. Approximately 1/5of all survey respondents were men.. The age distribution for the work forcetended to be bimodal, reflecting the career patterns of women and the laterentry of men into librarianship.. The annual salary for male professionals wascalculated at $12,732; for female professionals at $10,044; for malenonprofessionals at $7,878; and for female nonprofessionals at $6,313.. Maleprofessionals were found to have the highest rates of job and geographicmobility.. Conversely, female nonprofessionals were lowest in mobility.. Inexpressing a preference for continuing education programs in library science,professionals tended to request courses dealing with the organization oflibraries, health sciences institutions and their relationships, while nonprofessionals inclined towards courses in technical processing..\",\n",

A survey testing user reactions was conducted at the University ofVirginia Medical Library.. The results of the survey are based on replies by246 users who requested one or more MEDLINE searches between September 1972 andMarch 1973.. The findings indicate that over 93% believe that MEDLINE is a substantial improvement over the traditional methods of searching through theprinted indexes.. These respondents also stated that the results of MEDLINEsearches had assisted them in their clinical or research work, or both.. Askedwhether they would continue to use MEDLINE after the imposition of user chargeson July 1, 1973, about 75% said that they would.. The remaining 25% expressedsome reservation and doubts..

       "  '   The paper reviews the highlights of a four-week trial period (November 19 -December 18, 1970) during which the Medical Library of the University ofVirginia experimented with a new remote-access bibliographical control andretrieval system via its TWX machine.. The system, called AIM-TWX, wassponsored by the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communicationsand utilized a time-shared IBM 360/67 computer in Santa Monica, California..Citations from 109 clinically-oriented  journals from 1966 to date, includingthose currently included in the Abridged Index Medicus, may be retrievedeither on- or off-line..   Various aspects of this service are described, including problems ofstaffing, training, and record keeping, as well as the role of the MeSHvocabulary which is the principle \"language\" of the man-computer dialog..   The statistical results indicated that the system was used for approximately200 minuted on nineteen days and that an average of sixteen searches were runon any given day, or about 4.6 searches per hour of use.. In spite of an inexperienced staff who had little knowledge of the MeSH vocabulary and whosetraining schedule was limited to one four-hour session, the experiment washighly successful in terms of searches and citations..   At the end of the period, 298 searches had been run for 114 requestors,and  5,343 citations had been produced.. Only fifty-five searches yielded no citations.. The experiment generated a great deal of excitement and interestamong the staff of the Library and of the Medical Center..

       "  '  For many years administrators of library collections have soughtobjective criteria for assembling well-rounded periodical collectionsin the subject fields represented by their collections.  The nearestapproach to any criterion which does away with the a priori knowledgeof the specialist was first suggested by Gross and Gross in 1927.  Thismethod consists, essentially, of counting the bibliographic citations atthe conclusions of the articles in a basic periodical of the field underconsideration, and of arranging the journals cited in order of thefrequency of their citation.  Thus, in the field of chemistry, the references in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are counted anda list is made of the most frequently cited journals.  According to Grossand Gross, the journals which are cited most frequently in the Journal of theAmerican Chemical Society are the most valuable journals for a libraryto purchase in order to possess a well-rounded collection in chemistry.  Although the Gross and Gross method has been in use for almost twentyyears, the fundamental assumptions upon which the method is based havenever been examined.  These assumptions are:1. The value of a periodical to a professional worker is in direct   proportion to the number of times it is cited in the professional   literature.2. The journal or journals used as the base for the tabulation are   representative of the entire field.3. If more than one journal is used as a base, all of them can be weighted   equally.',\n",

Statistical bibliography may be defined as the assembling and interpretationof statistics relating to books and periodicals; it may be used in avariety of situations for an almost unlimited number of measurements.Within the last forty years bibliographical statistics have been collectedand explained in several fields of science for these main purposes: todemonstrate historical movements, to determine the national or universalresearch use of books and journals, and to ascertain in many localsituations the general use of books and journals.',\n",

       "  '  Mechanical means for expediting library work have been consideredfor many years, as an examination of the early pages of LibraryJournals bears out. The very first volume of the forerunner of the Bulletin,the Medical Library and Historical Journal, moreover, contained anarticle on the use of the \"typewriting machine\" in cataloging.  Telephoneshave long been accepted as library machines, and, except for unusualitems, hand bookbinding has given way to machine-bound books.  Nevertheless, when the term \"machine methods\" is used for librariestoday, the prevailing idea is that expensive and complicated electronicequipment must be employed, and, since few libraries are able to affordsuch equipment for themselves, it is generally assumed that none but thelargest libraries (the Library of Congress or the National Library ofMedicine, for example) will be able to employ already existing mechanicalmethods or devise systems specifically applicable to their own situations.

Columbia received nearly 2,000 journals and Yale over1,500; findings are based upon an analysis of canceled charge slips for issuespublished from 1959 through June 1962.. This combined study of recorded usagefor six months in the Columbia Medical Library (12.9 percent of circulationduring January through June 1962) and for one year in the Yale Medical Library(12.5 percent of 1961/62 circulation) revealed that a core of 262 journalssupplied 80 percent of use of titles published in the 1959 to mid-1962period..

       "  '   Users of information in science and technology have been studied in greatdetail with respect to material read, amount of time spent in reading andsearching the literature, categories of questions asked, an so on.. Probingfor this information has been undertaken by means of structured  and unstructured  interviews, diaries, surveys, and questionnaires..   Although a large amount of data has emerged on information usage and flow,the subjective response of scientists furnishes comment only on the satisfactionproduced by present information services and does not yield insight into theextent to which needs remain unsatisfied.. Relevance  figures based upon theresponse of systems to questions cannot be equated with satisfaction of needs,since questions constitute, in most cases, inadequate representations of underlying information needs..   Assessment of the needs of users of medical libraries and information systemmust, in fact, be made in relation to the observed behavior and experience ofbiomedical scientists.. There is room for well-designed experimentation whichcan explore the interaction of both psychological and environmental factors..Significant differences in information needs exist among and between individualssuch as researches and clinicians  in the same environment.. With respect toenvironment, it is hypothesized that the information needs for medicalpractitioners in remote areas might differ significantly from those of theircolleagues working in large metropolitan centers in close proximity to medicalschools, research institutions, and other rich sources of information fallout..   It is anticipated that experimentation will eventually result in amethodology which will permit the determination and prediction of theinformation needs of any identified groups of users in a specific environment..',\n",

The library is tested with representative sample of such documents to determine how long would be required for users toobtain these documents.. Test results are expressed in terms of a CapabilityIndex, which has a maximal value of 100 only if all the sample documents arefound \"on shelf\".. Specific tests employing samples of 300 documents have beendeveloped that are appropriate for academic an for \"reservoir\" biomedicallibraries.. Realistic field trials have demonstrated that these two tests arepractical to administer and that test results are adequately reproducible..When strict comparability is not important, a library can test itself.. Inassessing a reservoir library, test results are supplemented by data on itstypical processing time for interlibrary loan requests.. Currently these testsare being used in a national survey.. The general method is applicable to othertypes of libraries, provided appropriate test samples are established.. If their limitations are clearly understood, these \"Document Delivery Tests\"can be valuable tools for planning and managing library services..',\n",

However,it is also suitable for other kinds of libraries, and the Interview Guide andChecklist can be used for a self-survey by library stuff.. In addition to survey use, the inventory has a variety of educational, administrative,managerial, and research applications.. A methods for weighting the categoricalinventory data to reflect the relative desirability of different policies makes it possible to calculate scores indicating how a library\\'s policies comparewith those of an \"optimal\" library..

       "  '   A survey of present uses and arrangement of medical library card catalogs was made in order to determine current practices and trends.. Attention wasfocused on the influences of MeSH on the card catalog.. The results indicatethat the prevalent type of card catalog found in medical libraries is the divided catalog.. In addition, it appears that this catalog arrangement is gaining acceptance, and the trend is toward division.. MeSH has an effect on the organization of the card catalog; libraries indicate that it is an influential factor in the decision to divide the catalog..',\n",

For the whole sample, citation list in periodical articles were the principal sources of references, although forliterature published in the last fifteen months, abstracting and indexingjournals were the main sources.. Of the latter, Index Medicus proved to be themost fruitful source of references.. By asking whether the item requested wasreally useful to their work, a measure of the reliability of the differentsources of references was obtained..   Appendixes include the questionnaire, a list of the most frequently borrowedjournals, and a list of abstracting and indexing journals used as sources ofreferences..',\n",

Selected aspects of the descriptive data obtained on services to faculty and to medical students are presented and commented upon.. Comparisons with the findings of earlies surveys suggest that increases in the stuffs and budgets of medical school libraries over the past two decades have gone largely to supporting a rapidly increasing volume of service, rather than to any striking increase in the breadth and depth ofservices.. To facilitate summarization and comparisons among libraries the descriptive data were weighted and converted to quantitative measures; theweighting scheme was established by a group of five academic medical librariansto reflect the relative values the group assigned to different services..One these quantitative measures, the percentage score for overall servicesrelative to the optimal library, summarizes a library,s services in a singlefigure.. On this measure, medical school libraries ranged from 38 percent to 87 percent; the median overall score was 63 percent.. Results of some exploratory analysis are described; these analyses attempted ti find explanations for the observed differences among libraries and among geographicalregions on the quantitative measures.. Present and potential uses of the surveydata for managerial and research purposes are discussed..

Legislation known as the Medical Library Assistance Act(MLAA) was passed in 1965 which enabled the NLM to (1) initiate programs to assist the nation's medical libraries and (2) develop a medical library networkwith the establishment of regional medical libraries to link the NLM with localinstitutions..   The National Library of Medicine, through the MLAA, has made available $40.8million to the medical library community under a competitive grant and contract mechanism for the period July 1965 - June 1970.. A total of 604 projects has been executed in resources, research and development, training, construction,regional medical libraries, publications, and special scientific projects.. Anassessment is given of each of these programs and their impact on both the National Library of Medicine and individual medical libraries.. In the aggregate, these programs have significantly improved library and informationservices to the professional health user..

This survey led to the formulation of six criterion concepts  (accessibility, cost, user satisfaction, response time, cost/benefitratio and use).. The advantages and disadvantages of each method of measurement are discussed.. Several points which became clear during the analysis are discussed.. First, there is a relative lack of concern with the rationale behind the evaluation process, although the results invariably leadto a confused interpretation when there is no clear understanding of the purpose of an evaluation.. Second, the total library system is rarely considered; instead, each evaluation criterion is taken in isolation ratherthan as part of the whole.. Third, the library's preservation function has notbeen considered at all..\",\n",

       "  \"   The standardized Document Delivery Tests (DDT's) developed earlier (Bulletin56: 241-267, July 1968) were employed to assess the capability of ninety-twomedical school libraries for meeting the document needs of biomedical researchers, and the capability of fifteen major resource libraries for filling I-L requests from biomedical libraries.. The primary test data are summarized as statistics on the observed availability status of the 300 plus documents inthe test samples, and as measures expressing capability as a function of the mean time that would be required for users to obtain test sample documents..A mathematical model is developed in which the virtual capability of a library,as seen by its users, equals the algebraic sum of the basic capability affordedby its holdings; the combined losses attributable to use of its collection, processing, relative inaccessibility, and housekeeping problems; and the gainrealized by coupling with other resources (I-L borrowing).. For a particular library, or group of libraries, empirical values for each of these variables can be  calculated easily from the capability measures and the status statistics.. Regression equations are derived that provide useful predictions of basic capability from collection size.. The most important result of this work is that cost-effectiveness analyses can now be used as practical decision aids in managing a basic library service..

Forthis select portion of researchers the Index Medicus SDI is the more suitablemode of current awareness.. For a significant portion of the MIP staff, however, the score of Index Medicus is too restricted to suitable replace Current Contents..

       "  '  The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCMand PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio hasintensified the interest in a general theory of communication.  A basis forsuch a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartleyon this subject.  In the present paper we will extend the theory to include anumber of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, andthe savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original messageand due to the nature of the final destination of the information.  The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing atone point either exactly or approximately a message selected at anotherpoint.  Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptualentities.  These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to theengineering problem.  The significant aspect is that the actual message isone selected from a set of possible messages.  The system must be designedto operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actuallybe chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. ',\n",

       "  '  In this final installment of the paper we consider the case where thesignals or the messages or both are continuously variable, in contrast withthe discrete nature assumed until now.  To a considerable extent thecontinuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discretecase by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finitenumber of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved ona discrete basis.  As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters ingeneral approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case.  Thereare, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change ofemphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results toparticular cases.  We will not attempt, in the continuous case, to obtain our results withthe greatest generality, or with the extreme rigor of pure mathematics, sincethis would involve a great deal of abstract measure theory and wouldobscure the main thread of the analysis.  A preliminary study, however,indicates that the theory can be formulated in a completely axiomatic andrigorous manner which includes both the continuous and discrete cases andmany others. The occasional liberties taken with limiting processes in thepresent analysis can be justified in all cases of practical interest.',\n",

       "  \"  The book deals almost entirely with theory and principles.  Onlynow and then, if it seems necessary to a complete understanding ofthe implications of theory, is some detail of practice briefly described.  It follows that the work is not a substitute for rules of entry anddescription, subject headings rules and lists, classification schemes, orother similar reference books.  Instead, it is only a commentary on suchworks, and it does not profess to comment on more than a few ofwhat seem to be the most important aspects of each.  Comments are made only on cataloging in the United States.Many interesting practices have always been part of catalogingabroad.  But to write of these practices also would have taken severalbooks.  This work looks at the foreign scene only when it seemsnecessary to understand fully some procedure in this country.  If areader in some other country finds anything in this book helpful,that will be, I hope, good for him and for his country's cataloging.I am not at all sure, however, that what we do and think in thiscountry will be of value in other countries with other conditions.  Inno sense is this a book of American intellectual imperialism.\",\n",

       "  '    This is the final report of the Colorado AcademicLibraries Book Processing Center (CALBPC)project.  The CALBPC project was begun in 1965by nine academic libraries in Colorado in an effortto establish a centralized acquisition and processingcenter.  The report of Phase I-II, completedin June 1968, dealt primarily with a general feasibilitystudy, the design of the central system, costsof acquiring and processing in nine libraries and anumber of related concerns such as accounting, thecongruence of approval plans and user attitudes towardlibrary services.    This report focuses on the experimental operationswhich were concluded officially on September 30,1969.  Whereas the Phase I-II study dealt with thetheory and principles upon which a system mightbe based, we are presently concerned with thepragmatics of book processing, the obstacles encountered, and the solutions achieved.    Although this report deals primarily withcooperative acquisitions and processing, we believeit also contributes to a better understanding ofcooperative programs.  The experiment was designedto monitor operations throughout the acquisition/cataloging cycle.  Performance and cost measurementswere made on most internal and external aspectsof the system.  Monitoring also extended intothe participating libraries where a productacceptance study was conducted.  A secondaryobjective of the project was to observe the relationships which formed between the participantsand the central agency, such as the interface ofsystems and the human interaction of participantsand the Center.',\n",

Some librarians think it is,and support their view by heaping scorn on the heads of those who, like theClassification Research Group, actually spend years of their time intheoretical discussions that seem to result in more and more abstruse anddifficult complications to what ought to be a straightforward exercise.Yet today we can see clearly two relatively new spectacles on the libraryscene: on the one hand, some librarians are criticizing the DecimalClassification (especially as used in the British National Bibliography)for being too detailed and unwieldy; on the other hand, some librarians,and still more information officers, are busy revising the UniversalDecimal Classification in order to make it more detailed.  In the nextfield, as it were, computerized indexing and retrieval systems are poundingaway at the ever-growing masses of literature, producing results thatimpress computer specialists but not information users, who are so deafened by the noise that they cannot hear what is new.',\n",

Three years practical use of the system here explained, leads himto believe that it will accomplish this result; for with its aid, the catalogues, shelf lists, indexes, and cross-references essential to thisincreased usefulness, can be made more economically than by any other methodwhich he has been able to find.

The term relative usage was defined and used to study the effect of: (1) language, (2) country of publication, (3) year of publication, and (4) year of accession of a monograph title.. An attempt was made to fit a regression model for titles in English by quantifyingthe last three independent variables with relative usage as the dependent variable.. Functions based on the above variables have been developed to identify monograph titles for storage..   A questionnaire was employed to stady the usage of library facilities and to gather opinions of library patrons.. Purpose of visiting the library, reason for checkout of library material, reason for preferring library or home for the use of library material, etc., were analyzed on the basis of the replies received..',\n",

To test this assumption the authorhypothesized that no correlation exists between the subjects of books taken outof the library and those used within the library.. Counts were made of books left on tables, chairs, desks, and other surfaces and correlated to books charged out.. Two studies were made.. In the first, books were counted within finely delineated LC and Dewey class spans relating to academic departments..In the second, books were counted within the broad LC first and second letters and the Dewey tens.. In the first case, the overall correlation was .86; in thesecond, with less data, .84.. The author concludes that out-of-library circulation totals can be reliable indicators of in-library use..

Its purpose is to generalize at a very elementary level a methodology or approach which can beused in conducting a systems study. Systems work is discussed here as a pointof view; a logical, coherent, from the top down, preface to decision-makingand resource allocation which utilizes a very powerful body of sophisticatedtechniques.  The approach and techniques reviewed in this paper, however,will be those on the most elementary  level.  No attempt will be made todiscuss the techniques of queueing, inventory management, linear programming,simulation, marginal analysis, game theory, statistical inference, or any ofthe other highly sophisticated techniques available to the operations research systems analysis (OR/SA) analyst. When the systems approach is clearlyunderstood and properly used, it becomes a potent weapon in the arsenalof the administrator.  Rather than a review of the tools themselves, adelineation of this systems methodology and point of view will be considered in this article.  The methodology discussed here embraces a number of standard techniques used by the systems engineer, time and motion analyst, operations researcher, and occasionally, even the librarian.',\n",

Five sourcesare identified by the authors, including pressures from the president's office,library stuff, faculty, and students.. These difficulties coupled with a declining ability to meet user needs, the lack of cohesive library planning, and an institutional inability to accommodate change have all contributed to thedeclining status of the library director..

Yet the gap between theory and practice, so common in thehistory of American radical movements, is in some quarters growingwider.  Some of the most militant of American radicals, in theNew Left or in the movement for Black liberation, have at leasttemporarily avoided any serious concern with social theory.  This neglect of theory doubtless has various origins.  In somepart it is due to the fact that these social movements are still newand their political activism consumes their necessarily limitedenergies and resources; the new radicalisms will, in short, need timeto produce their new theories.  Although the neglect of theory isscarcely peculiar to Americans, it is in part also due to the factthat American radicals are often more American than they know andmay prefer the tangible outcomes of pragmatic politics to theintangible outputs of theory.  Again, part of their neglect of theoreticalproblems is probably due to the close links that some young radicalshave with the \"hippie\" contingent of their generation, whose moreexpressive and aesthetic styles of rejecting American culturedispose them to avoid what they take to be the sterile \"hassles\" ofintellectual confrontation.

       "  \"  In this note we attempt to point out why boolean functionsare, in general, not applicable in information retrievalsystems.  First, we wish to stress that a system, which supposedlyis to serve a certain purpose, has to try to optimize someoverall performance rather than certain detailed parts ofit.  This situation is, of course, well known.   Saying that a system should cater to an optimal performanceimplies that the reward varies with different circumstances.That is, there may always be some customers who will not agreethat the system's output is satisfactory.  However, theseshould be relatively few.  In the case of an informationretrieval system, let us consider one whose function is tofurnish a reference list as a reaction to a question.  So, if we have a set of documents S and a set of questionsQ, the system has to assign to each question q, an answer A(q)which is a subset of S.  Naturally, this answer cannot bechosen arbitrarily; it should reflect a relation betweenthe question and the resulting reference list.  Usuallyone says that the documents in the list are relevant tothe question.  More precisely stated, we assume that theenquirer expects a certain reference list, namely the onehe would have procured had he himself probed the documentsin the set.\",\n",

When text which the program has not seen beforeis input to it, it comprehends that text by correctly relatingeach (explicit or implicit) assertion of the new text to a largememory.  This memory is a \"semantic network\" representingfactual assertions about the world.  The program also creates copies of the parts of its memorywhich have been found to relate to the new text, adaptingand combining these copies to represent the meaning of thenew text.  By this means, the meaning of all text the programsuccessfully comprehends is encoded into the same format asthat of the memory.  In this form it can be added into thememory.  Both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilitiesfor correctly relating text to the memory\\'s prior content are tobe taught to the program as they are needed.  TLC presentlycontains a relatively small number of examples of suchassertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations forexpressing either of these are provided.  Thus the programnow corresponds to a general process for comprehendinglanguage, and it provides a methodology for adding theadditional information this process requires to actuallycomprehend text of any particular kind.  The memory structure and comprehension process of TLCallow new factual assertions and capabilities for relatingtext to such stored assertions and capabilities for relatingtext to such stored assertions to generalize automatically.That is, once such an assertion or capability is put into thesystem, it becomes available to help comprehend a great manyother sentences in the future.',\n",

The happy feature is that the book provides information required to limit the effect to that of tantalizing rather than frustrating. For there is given here a wholly adequate description of the nature of the Corpus ofPresent-Day Edited American English on which this study is based, the details of its constituents, and the modes of its transfer to tape.  A replica of that tape is available at a small cost in money, which is minuscule compared to the cost in time needed to produce a like corpus.

       "  \"  Far-reaching changes in the patterns of communication in scienceare at present in motion, which seem likely to have fundamentaleffects on scientists's use of and access to existing knowledge.These changes derive from the increasing involvement of computertechniques in the publication, dissemination and retrieval of scientificand technical information.  Many of the implications of the changesare not yet clear.  Information-handling is rapidly changing from alabour-intensive industry to a capital-intensive one, as soaringman-power requirements reflect the increasing flow of information andincreasing demands for timeliness, accuracy, and improved access.But the changes to be effected also have major social implications;the reasons for publication and use of information are complex,reflecting the factors of a sociological nature which are still imperfectly understood.  The rate at which innovations in information-handling win acceptance from scientists is determined partly by theirappreciation of the greater flexibility which the novel methods offer,but also by the sensitivity, on the part of the designers and operatorsof information systems, to the needs and habits of users, and to theirperception of the usefulness of the newer methods.\",\n",

They therefore involve large and growing dictionaries and many entail inefficient utilizationof storage because of the distribution characteristics..   An alternative approach may be based on the analysis of text in terms ofsets of variable-length character strings, the frequency distributions ofwhich are much less disparate than those of words..

What is lacking is a satisfactory generalclassification of knowledge and an adequate clarification of the philosophicalproblems underlying such classification.

Public libraries are those which are free to all residents of the library'sdistrict and supported primarily from general public funds or taxes leviedfor library purposes.  Local public libraries, systems of public libraries,and state library agencies are included in this category.  School libraries are those maintained by the governing boards ofschools whether they be public, private, or parochial.  School librariesat the elementary, junior high school, and senior high school level areincluded.  Academic-research libraries include the libraries of institutions ofhigher education, both public and private, as well as libraries which,while they might be defined as either public or special, are widely knownfor their research resources.  Junior college libraries, college libraries,university libraries, and technical school libraries are included asacademic libraries.  The Library of Congress, the Newberry Library, and Linda Hall Library are examples of nonacademic research libraries.  Special libraries are those directed toward making information availableto people within a particular organization with fairly well-definedinformation needs.  Business and industrial libraries and the libraries ofnonprofit organizations are common examples.

(2) The complexity of the field of document reproduction today which has resulted from the enormous technical advances made in the past fifteen years.  The need for the coining of the new class word - reprography (an unfortunategraft of a Latin fragment on a Greek root) - is in itself indicative of the great changes that have come about.  Processes and methods which formerly were discrete and distinctive have now become intricately interrelated. New processesand combinations of processes with different and astonishing capabilitiescontinue to appear.  This revolution in the document copying field has been powerfully augmented by intensive competition on the part of manufacturers for a share of the vast and lucrative office-records copying field.

In order to make the differences existing between the varioussolutions and the unsatisfactory character revealed by many ofthem more evident, a great number of examples in a variety oflanguages, extracted from cataloguing codes, national bibliographies, printed lists of corporate headings have been added.  These examplesare also intended to draw attention to differences existing withregard to various technical details, such as punctuation, capitalization, transliteration, etc.  In addition, many of these examples will clearly prove thatcertain solutions which may be considered to be suitable for onecountry or one language would not satisfy the requirements ofanother country or another language.  In the study, examination and analysis of codes has been complemented by references to professional literature on the subjectavailable to the author, and by an analysis of opinions expressedthere.  Special attention has been paid to comparisons of cataloguingpractices and citation usages, and to investigations of the users'approach to corporate headings.

Weare both concerned with the dynamic process by which scientific knowledgeis acquired rather than with the logical structure of the products ofscientific research.  Given that concern, both of us emphasize, as legitimate  data the facts and also the spirit of actual scientific life, and both of usturn often to history to find them.  From this pool of shared data, we drawmany of the same conclusions.  Both of us reject the view that scienceprogresses by accretion; both emphasize instead the revolutionary process bywhich an older theory is rejected and replaced by an incompatible new one;and both deeply underscore the role played in this process by the oldertheory's occasional failure to meet challenges posed by logic, experiment,or observation.  Finally, Sir Karl and I are united in opposition to a numberof classical positivism's most characteristic theses.  We both emphasize, forexample, the intimate and inevitable entanglement of scientific observationwith scientific theory; we are correspondingly sceptical of efforts toproduce any neutral observation language; and we both insist that scientistsmay properly aim to invent theories that explain observed phenomena andthat do so in terms of real objects, whatever the latter phrase may mean.\",\n",

       "  '  During the last several decades, science and technology haveundergone a drastic transformation.  The enormity and depth of thistransformation can be measured in many ways.  It can be measuredin terms of the number of students enrolled in graduate andundergraduate schools offering degrees in the physical and appliedsciences, in terms of the number of new devices, products andinnovations introduced into the military establishment and into the civilian sector of our economy, in terms of the number of scientists andengineers employed by industry and public and private institutions,in terms of the amounts of money expended annually on researchand development, in terms of the number of technical reports, books,journals, papers, reprints, and conference proceedings stemmingfrom these expenditures, and in many other ways.

(For this reason, sociological concepts are defined when they areintroduced.)  More than five hundred publications on the diffusion ofinnovations are reviewed here.  The innovations studied rangefrom new drugs among physicians to hand tools among primitivetribes, and from driver training among public high schools to hybrid corn among farmers.  Although a generallyconsistent set of findings has emerged from these studies, asearch of the literature shows little attempt to summarize andevaluate available results and theories on the spread of ideas.This volume synthesizes these findings and theories.

       "  '  As one of the early members of the computer community, I havebeen keenly interested in the development of quantitative methodologiesin the social and behavioral sciences, and their encouragementby the data processing environment.  The economists, with an alreadyestablished mathematical orientation, were among the earliest beneficiariesof the machine technology that enhances their ability toconstruct the test models of economic behavior.  Today, statisticalmethods have so affected many disciplines that it is not unusual fordoctoral programs to accept statistical techniques as a substitute forone foreign language.  Similarly, the ability to program in anappropriate language is also frequently as acceptable as French orGerman in providing the research skills needed by doctoral students atThe City University of New York and at other universities.  The chief function of this directory, in terms of academic suppliesof data, is not to reinventory the social science data archivesthat are well-known to the academic community, not to duplicate theannouncements of holdings that they themselves make available to theirmembers.  The reason for mentioning them and indicating the nature oftheir holdings is to make this kind of data resource known to thoseresearchers, either in or out of the university, who are not sufficientlyaware of these important resources.',\n",

       "  \"    The report is concerned with the social utility of libraries andwith the factors that appear to be requirements for effectiveprograms.  In the absence of established standards or criteria formeasuring program effectiveness, we have substituted a comparative analysis ofa number of programs based on detailed observation of the program process;a survey of needs and interests of thetarget groups, both users and nonusers; and an assessment of thelibrary's role in the target neighborhood as it is perceived by othercommunity institutions serving the same groups.  Thus a basis forcomparisons and for judgements has been introduced which providesa foundation for suggestions as to the direction in which programsof service to the disadvantaged might move.  To achieve the study objectives, library programs and practicesin low-income neighborhoods were examined in a number of cities.In each of fifteen cities data were collected through interview andobservation in four subject areas: (1) the needs and interests ofthe community residents, (2) library services in relation to otheravailable community resources, (3) the nature and scope of theneighborhood library program and its relation to the rest of thelibrary system, and (4) available measures of the impact oreffectiveness of the program.\",\n",

What they developed was of a far wider scopethan the establishment of a new technique dealing with printedand non-printed documents.  The great deal which inspired them, and those who workedside by side with them, was to render accessible the totality ofwhat is crystallized from human thought and to make of it acommon treasure of mankind, serving to bring mutual comprehensionand to build for peace by the co-operation of all men of goodwillof all nations.  It was in this spirit that my friend Bradford joined those men,whose noble faces have passed and to whom it never was given tosee the achievement of the work to which they devoted their lives.  And it was in this spirit that Bradford, thanks to his knowledgeand experience as scientist as well as librarian, not onlygave his strong and valuable support to the common work butadded to it fundamental and constructive new elements.  Just for this reason the present book we owe to him gives farmore than a mere compilation of facts and experiences.  Sucha compilation would indeed be welcome because, curiouslyenough, up to now, there is no good general treatise ondocumentation available.

       "  \"  This study addresses itself to several questions important to all publiclibraries.  How should the library allocate its book budget?  What kinds ofbooks should it tend to buy?  What types of households use the library?  Whydo some households not use the library?  What is the cost of the variousservices provided by the library?  What specific steps can the library taketo improve its services?  What are the library's options in choosing among thedifferent circulation systems?  For how long should the library allow books tobe checked out?  How frequently should overdue notices be sent out?  Is aninvestment in a security system worthwhile?  We have studied these questions in the context of one public library - theBeverly Hills (California) Public Library - and have developed a methodologyfor determining answers to them, as well as to other questions that aroseduring our investigation.

The study will attempt to answer two specific questions:1) Is it economical for colleges and universities to selectso-called little-used books from the regular bookstacks andstore them elsewhere? 2) Is the cost factor the only one auniversity need consider in adopting a storage program; and,if not, how is cost related to the others?  The facts and conclusions in this report are based onthe library book storage situation as of 1969.

       "  '  The exponential growth of the literature of science and technology is aphenomenon which scientists have been living with for the past 300 years.It is in the nature of such growth that its effect is recognized only slowly,but when a critical point is reached its consequences can be overwhelming.In science information this point has now been reached.  To take but one field, chemistry, it took well over two centuries for the first million papersto be published, and over 30 years, from 1907 to 1938, for the first millionto be abstracted in Chemical Abstracts.  We are now at the stage where onemillion papers have been abstracted in a five-year period - 1962-1967 - andbefore 1975 the point will have been reached where one million papers, equalto the output of the whole pre-war generation of chemists, will bepublished and abstracted in a single year. The first scientific serial beganpublication in 1665.  Some 290 years later, in 1956, the Science MuseumLibrary was receiving 9,000 current scientific serials.  Within only afurther 11 years the National Lending Library for Science and Technology(N.L.L.) was receiving over three times this number.  The growth in the useof scientific literature is no less spectacular.  Thus, for example, in 1930the number of loans by the Science Museum Library was 10,000.  In 1967 theN.L.L., which had taken over the national lending function of the ScienceMuseum Library, lent well over half-a-million items, a total exceeding that ofall the loans by the Science Museum Library between 1929 and 1947 (a periodwhich itself saw the discovery of nuclear fission and its application forpeaceful uses, enormous progress in antibiotics, developments in syntheticmaterials and great advances in all branches of science and technology).There are some signs that the rate of increase implied in these examplesmay not be maintained, but any flattening-out that may develop will be ata very high level indeed.',\n",

       "  \"  Librarians, publishers, and information system engineers have verylittle verified information and few guidelines to describe the user's specificrequirements for information.  Such information is needed to properlydesign or evaluate the information systems.  To date, most of the statementsof requirements have been rather subjective, and often reflect opinionrather than actual fact.  Relatively little objective data have beenobtained.  This is probably due in large part to the fact that there areextremely difficult methodological problems in trying to determine andstate user requirements in a meaningful manner.  This paper suggests anapproach or point of view that might help this situation by providing amethod of phrasing the statements of user requirements in a moreconvenient and meaningful manner.  This paper also furnishes severalexamples of such statements, and discusses the techniques and data thatsupport these statements.  In this paper, attention is initially focused on the information requirementsof workers in the field of science and technology, with no seriousattempt made to include workers in other fields.  However, it seems quitelikely that the approach, and perhaps even the stated principles, could beextended and generalized to cover other fields of knowledge.\",\n",

       "  '  Several major developments have contributed to the rapid emergenceof the field of error-correcting codes over the past two decades.Externally, the cost of solid-state electronic devices has decreased almost asdramatically as their size.  This has stimulated the development of digitalcomputers and peripheral devices and this, in turn, has caused a dramaticincrease in the volume of data communicated between suchmachines.  The intolerance of computing systems to error, and in somecases the inherently critical nature of the data demand the use of eithererror-free facilities or some type of error-detecting or correcting code inthe terminal devices.  In many cases the latter approach is the more economical.',\n",

Therefore, the inquiry begins with a consideration of thecommunication system within the individual as related to his physiological,neurological, and psychological structure, and its meaning for learning andreading patterns and characteristics.

       "  \"  The use of classification in libraries is traditional and its value isappreciated.  For documentation and information retrieval ingeneral, other techniques such as alphabetical indexing andmachine selection are also available.  That classification is ofvalue in information retrieval as well as in book arrangement is,however, made evident in two ways.  First, to achieve consistencyand subtlety in alphabetical indexing and machine selectiondesigners of such retrieval systems find the need to introduceclassificatory techniques.  Second, there is a continuing demandfor the construction of special classifications for detailed arrangementand cataloguing of documents in restricted but intensivelycultivated fields of knowledge.  It is to help meet these demands, particularly the second, thatthis guide has been prepared.  The techniques of detailed depthclassification have been greatly developed during the past decade,and instruments of much greater subtlety and efficiency than thetraditional 'tree-of-knowledge' schemes can now be designed.These developments have been reported mainly as research papersin a variety of library journals and are often made unnecessarilydifficult to follow by the use of unfamiliar terminology.There is a need for a more simply written and more readilyavailable practical guide to the use of the newer techniques ofclassification.\",\n",

Government expendituresfor research and development have increased from a modestannual rate of $200 million some thirty years ago to $17 billion today.The research budgets of the private sector of the economy, which werealmost miniscule in the 1930's, total approximately $8 billion today.These expenditures have had their many tangible and visible results,ranging from nylon and antibiotics to radar and solid state electronics,but what is not so generally appreciated is the additional productrepresented by the increasing inventory of ideas and new knowledgewhose application, for the most part, is still a potential one.  Thesophisticated and often urgent nature of some of the larger products inwhich we engage today, which require vast research expenditures tofind the efficient way, or the economical way, or the safe way, or themost accurate way to accomplish some end purpose, also produces anincrease in the national level of scientific and technological competencethat has not yet been transferred into the civilian economy.  Thevalue of the technical ideas now stored and awaiting application canbe estimated as a value many times larger than the annual rate ofbillions of dollars invested in the effort it took to develop this increasedtechnical capability.  As a national resource for underwriting furthereconomic and industrial development, this technical inventory is afactor of major importance.\",\n",

The context-free grammars are treated in detail, and such topicsas normal forms, derivation trees, and ambiguity are covered.  Four types ofautomata equivalent to the four types of grammars are described.  Theseautomata are the finite automaton, the pushdown automaton, the linearbounded automaton, and the Turing machine.  The Turing machine is covered indetail, and unsolvability of the halting problem shown.

To cast light on these questions the presentpaper examines the role of informal and formal channels withinthe overall system of scientific dissemination in psychology,considers the special advantages of informal communication,and outlines certain relations between informal and formalchannels.  In a final section of the paper, two experimentsin scientific communication are described; one experiment beingbuilt about an innovation that attempts to \"informalize\" formalchannels while the other is built about another innovation that,in general, attempts to \"formalize\" an informal channel.',\n",

Sgall's book (1967a, in Czech), which represents the first attempt at asystematic formulation of the conception of generative description that hasgradually been elaborated by our research group.  We do not claim that any particular question has been answered here in adefinitive way, but the conception of a generative system based on anarticulation of the semantic relation (see Section 1.3.4) may perhaps beinteresting in connection with the present development of algebraic linguistics.This conception originated in 1963-1964, mainly as a reaction to the existingform of transformational description.  It has not yet been possible to take themore recent impulses into account to an extent that would be adequate to theirscope and theoretical significance.  Only some aspects of these impulses arecommented on in the relevant parts of the present book.  We do not present acomplete characterization of a system that could be regarded as a counterpartto the new version of transformational grammar.  We have simply triedto formulate a conception that can serve as a starting point for thedevelopment of a new alternative.\",\n",

The last decade has brought new inventions of enormous potential.It will probably be two decades before we fully grasp the shattering effectthey will have on society.  These inventions include:  The communication satellite.  Suddenly this has provided telephoneand television links to the underdeveloped world.  Much larger satelliteswill be built and will have an enormous impact on education andcommunications both in the United States and throughout the world.  Thesatellite antennae in some underdeveloped countries stand next to fieldsploughed by oxen.  The helical waveguide.  A pipe, now operating, that can carry 250,000simultaneous telephone calls or equivalent information over long distances.  The laser.  This means of transmission, still in the research laboratory,has the potential of carrying many millions of simultaneous telephone callsor their equivalent.  Large-scale integration (LSI).  A form of ultraminiaturized computercircuitry that probably marks the beginning of mass production ofcomputers and computerlike logic circuitry.  It offers the potential ofextremely reliable, extremely small, and, in some of its forms, extremelyfast computers.  If large-enough quantities can be built, this circuitry canbecome very low in cost.  On-line real-time computers.  Computers capable of responding to manydistant terminals on telecommunication lines at a speed geared to humanthinking.  They have the potential of bringing the power and informationof innumerable computers into every office and eventually every home.  Picturephone.  A public dial-up telephone system in which subscriberssee as well as hear each other.  Large TV screens.  TV screens that can occupy a whole wall if necessary.  Cable TV.  Provides a cable into homes with a potential signal-carryingcapacity more than one thousand times that of the telephone cable.  Itcould be used for signals other than television.  Voice answerback.  Computers can now assembly human-voice words andspeak them over the telephone.  This fact, coupled with the Touchtonetelephone set, makes every such telephone a potential computer terminal.  Millimeter-wave radio.  Radio at frequencies in the band above themicrowave band can relay a quantity of information greater than all theother radio bands combined.  Chains of closely spaced antennas will distributethese millimeter-wave signals.  Pulse code modulation.  All signals, including telephone, Picturephone,music, facsimile, and television can be converted into digital bit streamand transmitted, along with computer data, over the same digital links.Major advantages accrue from this.  Computerized switching.  Computerized telephone exchanges are coming intooperation, and computer-like logic can be employed for switching and\"concentrating\" all types of signals.  Data banks.  Electronic storage for huge quantities of information thatcan be manipulated and indexed by computers and that can be accessed in afraction of a second.',\n",

Whereone or two examples were all that were available at that time to illustrateeach kind of application, now there are five to ten; where the cadre ofknowledgeable people in libraries at that time was small, now virtuallyevery major library has some kind of systems department; where the efforts atthat time were largely experimental and developmental, now there is a wealth.This second edition has therefore been written in a context totally differentfrom that of the first.  But its aims are the same; to ensure that practicing librarians and thatstudents in library schools approach the world of automation with knowledgeof its capabilities and limitations and with the techniques of systemsanalysis by which to analyze and evaluate alternative answers to the library'sprocessing problems.  The changes from the first edition therefore representnot a departure from that purpose but simply an updating of its content, toreflect the advances and experience gained, and an opportunity to correctthe errors (hopefully minor) that have been found through use of the firstedition.\",\n",

The sameapplies to the reader whose satisfaction depends largely on hisunstated expectations.  In today's world, when all of us are overwhelmedwith data from many sources, it is easy to understand why peopleare apt to feel that they are losing touch with developments even intheir own field.  One senses that there is also a growing awarenessof a loss of relatedness to the world at large.  This loss of relatednessleads to an increased need for organizing frames of reference to aidin intergrating the mass of rapidly changing information with which manmust cope.

They determinealso the quality of its successive generations of management.    Of course the process is circular, and herein lies the possibilityand the hope of future progress.  The key question for top managementis:  \"What are your assumptions (implicit as well as explicit) aboutthe most effective way to manage people?\"  From the answer to thisquestion flow the answers to the questions Mr. Sloan raised in ourdiscussion about the making of managers, as well as answers to manyother questions which perplex and confound management as it seeks toachieve more successfully the economic objectives of enterprise.  Itwill be clear to the reader that I believe many of our present assumptionsabout the most effective way to manage people are far from adequate.',\n",

Corporate goals may require the R & D  manager to simultaneously seekthe highest probable profits, the largest probable number of successes, and thegreatest probable profit per dollar spent.. Departmental goals may restrict themanager to some maximum budget, a minimum number of projects to be worked on, and minimum levels of accomplishment on specific projects.. In a sense, then, the research manager is faced with a constrained multiple-output production problem: how much to spend on which project and how much to spend overall.. This  paper shows how a slight modification of Hess' approach to projectselection  and an analogy to the theoretical economics of a multiple-productfactory have been used to help our research management simultaneously solvethese project selection, resource allocation, and budget determination problems..

Data were collected on about 300 ideas created in a divisional laboratory of a major U.S. corporation.. In general, these data support thea priori propositions.. Further, data analysis suggests that two pieces ofinformation are required before an idea is generated: 1) knowledge of a need,problem, or opportunity relevant to the company; and, 2) knowledge of a means ortechnique for satisfying the need, solving the problem, or capitalizing on the opportunity.. These results are discussed with respect to the stage of creativethought proposed by other investigators..

An experiment wasconducted at the research laboratories of Monsanto Company tomeasure the predictive validity and consistency of such forecasts.The results indicate that the eventual success or failure of certaintypes of R&D projects can be predicted by measuring the time shapeof polled probability of success forecasts.  Probability of successforecasts appear to yield more valid advance warning indicators thanseveral commonly used project status measures.  These results tendto support the hypothesis that R&D planning and control models thatare based on subjective probability estimates may reliably be usedby management to aid in early identification of eventually failingprojects, as well as to aid in project selection and project funding.

The method analyses the index terms assigned to the references cited by the new article.. This produces a list of index terms weighted according to their expected correlation with the subject matter of the new article.. Thus, the indexer is presented with the weighted list of proposed indexing terms as an aid..   An evaluation is made of the results produced by the technique for a trialset of documents.. These documents have already been indexed for the MEDLARS system.. The list of actual index terms for this trial set of documents is compared with the set of index terms proposed by the technique for each document.. The results of this comparison are encouraging, and they are discussed in the paper..   The economic aspects of implementing the technique in a working information retrieval system is considered.. This included the expected benefits, and an estimate of the cost of using the technique as an aid in terms of computer time and indexer time..',\n",

This classification hasvalidity, but is not further elaborated, and indeed she reverts to a lessprecise language; for example, in defining \"second order noise,\" she uses theambiguous phrase \"a formally relevant document which is not really relevant\" -presumably meaning not subjectively relevant, according to the real need ofthe enquirer.

       "  '   An evaluation of graph theoretical clusters of index terms which can be extracted from an automatically indexed document collection, and the effects of employing such cluster in automatic document retrieval is described.. The graph theoretical cluster which were developed from six data base under two different cluster definition were analyzed for average size and related data.. The clusters were also used to expand the queries in each of six data bases to determine the effect of the expansions on the document retrieval results..   Although a large variety of clusters and associated query explanations wereobtained, no significant improvements in the document retrieval performance were achieved.. In some cases, however, significant degradations in the retrieval performance occurred.. Although seemingly meaningful clusters can beobtained, the results indicate that the effort involved in finding clusters and adding the clustered terms to queries is far to great to warrant their usein an operational system.. The data bases employed were relatively small, and the  authors caution against generalizing these results to large data bases or other  situations..',\n",

       "  \"  In a day when it is hard enough in most fields of science tokeep abreast of new and non-redundant literature, thepublication of collected papers, like the estate of holymatrimony, is something not to be undertaken 'unadvisedly,lightly or wantonly'.  In the present case it would not have beenconsidered at all but for the kindly initiative of my respectedfriend Professor Roman Jakobson, whose persistent encouragementalone overcame that distaste which most of us feelfor our ten- to twenty-year-old productions and brought thisfirst volume to the point of no return.  It is true that theseexploratory papers were scattered among an unconscionably awkward selection of publications for anyone wanting tofollow them up.  On the other hand, as most of them werewritten for specific occasions, each of which demanded somerehearsal of points covered in earlier essays, the resultingrepetitiveness presented a special problem.  With occasionalexceptions, redundancy could have been eliminated onlyat the cost of mutilating individual papers.  The solutionadopted has been to leave almost all repetitive passagesintact, offsetting in small print those that can be skippedwithout loss by readers of the earlier chapters.  Where somecomment has seemed necessary, by way of foreword or postscript to the original papers, the passages added havebeen italicized. \",\n",

       "  \"    The present book embodies a change in structure and focus to reflectthe fact that the reader of today's book is much more likely to be aninterested college student with a great awareness of the current informationrevolution than was the case ten years ago.  Thus, hardware, materials, andprocesses used in connection with information systems are discussed first,in Chapters Two through Four.  The subject of information retrieval per sebegins with Chapters Five and Six, which have to do with librarianship and documentation.  Because of their somewhat historical slant, thesechapters (along with Seven) are the only ones taken from the 1963 bookwhich adhere to their original character.  Chapter Seven presents a simplifiedconcept of an information system and its components, and paves the way fordiscussion of computerized retrieval in the chapters to follow, especiallyfor data retrieval in Chapter Eight and document retrieval in Chapter Nine.Chapters Ten through Twelve, on language processing, evaluation, and userstudies, describe important facets of the information retrieval field that havedeveloped strongly since 1963.\",\n",

       "  '   An articulated subject index is one in which logical transformations of natural language phrases containing prepositions or connectives are employed to organize the noun phrases as subject headings, with subordinate displays of the remainder of the phrases.. The best-known example of the articulated subject index is that to Chemical Abstracts..   It has been shown that a well-defined transformation links the entry, as it appears in the index, with the original phrase, in natural order, as it was first compiled by the indexer.. A reverse transformation can be used to generate potential index entries from indexing phrases containing one or more prepositions or connectives..   A simple model has been devised for the generation of articulated subject index entries from natural language indexing phrases which exclude infinitivesor words acting as gerunds or participles.. A sorting algorithm has also been developed, the purpose of which is to select those entries which lead to greatest organization in the index display..   Deviations from the model in manually-produced indexes are described.. The potential value of certain of these characteristics in information retrieval is examined..',\n",

       "  '   A small-scale, computer-based SDI system in plasma physics and the related subjects is described briefly.. The system serves about 100 research scientists and engineers and uses title input only in order to minimize input costs.. Theimplications of this approach and its effect upon the system parameters isdiscussed.. Some comparison of the costs of the computer-based system with those of a manual system is made..   Further experiments are described in which the service is expanded to external users on a world-wide basis, the aim being to compare, under controlledconditions, the parameters of the small-scale internal service with those of an external service on a wide scale..   The paper concludes with some observations on the future development and organization of computer-assisted services, their possibilities and the main problems which are likely to arise..',\n",

       "  '   Two widely used criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of information retrieval system are, respectively, the recall and the precision.. Since the determination of these measures is dependent on a distinction between documents which are relevant to a given query and documents which are not relevant to thatquery, it has sometimes been claimed that an accurate, generally valid evaluation cannot be based on recall and precision measures..   A study was made to determine that effect of variations in relevance assessments on the average recall and precision values used to measure retrieval effectiveness.. Using a collection of 1200 documents in information science for test purposes, it is found that large scale differences in the relevance assessments do not produce significant variations in average recall and precision.. It thus appears that properly computed recall and precision data may represent effectiveness indicators which are generally valid for many distinct user classes..',\n",

While a knowledgeable human can make the selection on an intuitive basis, automatic indexing requires a precise operational criterion for defining and selecting good and useful index terms.. Two principles of selection are proposed:specification and selection of useful terms, and specification and exclusion of useless terms.. Because of the nebulous nature and meaning of\"good index terms\", and the difficulties involved in devising machine algorithmsfor their selection, this research in automatic indexing is based on the principle of excluding useless terms.. Even so,fully automatic indexing was not achieved in this study.. Single words proved to be little value as index terms..Multiple word terms were generated by the computer, but no algorithm could successfully eliminate the useless phrases.. Final selection had to be made by the experimenter.. A comprehensive and useful book index was achieved by using machine-aided rather than fully automated indexing techniques..',\n",

This had tended to indicate thatcomputer use is economically justified mainly for housekeeping operations in the large scale organizations..   The present paper takes a wider view and included in its appraisal the costsinvolved in information gathering and dissemination for the total system representing the information services and its users.. It is suggested that the inclusion of cost elements associated with user time devoted to information gathering tends to shift the economic appraisal in favor of computer applicationin information work..   In fact, such computer use appears to find its main stimulus and economic justification    in an environment that provides strong incentives to minimize the total cost of the system whilst maximizing its benefits to the users..   To illustrate this some example are given based on experience gained in research data handling and the operation of SDI services in an industrial research establishment..',\n",

       "  \"  The purpose of an information-retrieval system is to provide the user withcitations relevant to his query.  Since the user is the only person competentto make the final judgement of relevance it is natural to suppose that theselection of items from a data base will lead to two kinds of retrievalerror.  The extent of these errors is expressed by the familiar measuresof performance, precision and recall.  Precision measures the failure of thesystem to retrieve only relevant documents while recall measures its failureto retrieve all relevant documents actually present in the data base.  It isdifficult to visualize a situation in which a user would find advantage inbeing provided with irrelevant citations.  From the user's point of view,therefore, a system which offers less than 100 per cent precision is adeficient system.\",\n",

       "  '   Computer searches on Chemical Titles tapes for current awareness at the University of Alberta since May, 1968, have provided sufficient data to allow formulation of a cost function based on the number of titles searched, the length of questions, the extent to which questions may be batched, and certain details regarding the allowed forms of question.. With different choice of parameters the cost function could be adapted to apply to searches of other data bases..   An attempt to make retrospective searching economically feasible has led toformulation of different search techniques.. It is suggested that the search procedure should be designed to minimize computation time at the expense of convenience in the form of output, but that facilities should be included so that the user who is willing to play the additional cost may receive output in a more convenient form..   In recognition of the fact that the form of search question should be dependent on the vocabulary of the data base, a program has been developed to modify a question so that it is optimal for searches on the given data base..',\n",

       "  '  Many of the large-scale mechanized information systems in operation todaygrew up because of the need of the military and para-military establishmentsto have rapid access to large quantities of scientific and technologicalinformation.  This paper will deal with two complementary efforts in thefield of social sciences, where an awareness of the information problem isacute, and the global needs staggering.  The target audiences for these twosystems are on the one hand social science researchers and on the otherpolicy planners and makers in the broad field of economic and social development.  An operational system (in the International Labour Office) will bedescribed, and an array of figures representing actual or theoretical operating costs will be given.  As could be expected, however, thesefigures relate only to costs of systems development, input preparation,file maintenance and retrieval.  No attempt can be made to evaluate in otherthan general terms the economic impact that the existence of such a systemmay have.  It can be readily demonstrated, however, that computer-assistedinformation systems may make sense within individual institutionalenvironments, and make greater sense when on-line systems linkingvarious collaborating institutions can result in enabling each to operatemore efficiently and at lower cost.  The existence of such on-linenetworks would make the greatest sense for users because of the possibilityof having access at a reasonable price to large information stores.',\n",

Nine chapters, each from a different technical book, were used as a text corpus for all the experiments.. In the first experiment, an attempt was made to construct a sentence dictionary of syntactic sentence types, for distinguishing extract-worthy sentences, but it proved unrewarding.. Nevertheless, the results indicated that sentence typingmight be used in a screening process in conjunction with other extracting techniques.. The later attempts to combine synactic and statistical criteria in the choice of extract sentences and index phrases proved more rewarding.. The sentences selected  by the extracting algorithm  were representative and are presented for the reader to peruse..

       "  ' Schultz, Claire K.',\n",
       "  '   To date, the many decisions among alternatives that are required in the course of developmental efforts to improve indexing have, with few exceptions, been guided primarily by criteria related to effectiveness, as measured by some objective method, or as judged subjectively.. Although effectiveness-type criteria may be adequate for work intended solely to advance the state-of-the-art, when the goal is to develop indexing techniques appropriate for operating services, it seems highly desirable to employ some criterion that takes cost as well as effectiveness into consideration.. The central problem of operating services can be reduced to either that of producing the best indexing possible at a given cost, or that of producing indexing of a given level of effectiveness at least cost.. In our current effort to develop rules for human, machine, and man-machine indexing, we employ a cost-effectiveness type of criterion in making the critical developmental decision.. The general approachis described  and illustrated with examples of how measures of cost and of effectiveness  were considered jointly in decision making, primarily for how toreduce cost of indexing at a given level of effectiveness.. Problems of defining cost are also discussed, such as how to divide indexing into discrete steps, the effects of long-term vs. short-term activity in humans and small-batch vs. large-batch considerations for machines..',\n",

Thus far, in our experiments on the physics literature,automatic classification has proven to be as good as or better than manualindexing and, in addition, potentially less expensive.. Empirically derived, our method is based upon a pattern discovery algorithm which use only the citation content of a document and with operates on the bibliographic links among papers.. The self-generated groups correspond to very specific subject headings; retrospective bibliographies generated in the procedures allow one to classify the subsequent literature with remarkably high recall and relevance ratios, close to 100%..',\n",

The total costs in connection with COMPENDEX are evaluated and divided into four main components:Disbursement to the supplier of the tape system, working expenses of the documentation center, costs of the electronic data processing, and expensesconnected with the procurement of the original material to the subscribers..They can choose between including or deleting the COMPENDEX abstracts duringsequential text scanning and printing-out.. Search profiles are formed by the terms (word, author, journal code) connected by AND/OR/NOT-logic and weightfactors..

We describe the designcriteria of such an on-line system based on our experience of a pilot system which has been operational for 2 years, emphasizing the importance ofminimizing the number of disk accesses.. We recommend the use of hash coding for searching in a thesaurus and point out that the user of an on-line system should use the most precise terms first and the common terms last - the opposite of the procedure in a manual search..',\n",

       "  '   Retrospective search of large document data bases requires development of special techniques for automatic compression of data and minimization of the number of input-output operations to the computer accessible files.. Also, the computer program should be designed to require a relatively small amount of internal memory..   The present paper contains a description of the structure of a program that meets the above requirements.. The vocabulary of the data base is automatically expressed in terms of 8, 16 and 24 bit codes chosen to point to the natural spelling in a dictionary.. Thus file size is reduced without the necessity forextensive processing for decoding.. Use of a compressed bit string invertedindex greatly reduces search time, and a storage management system enables longstrings to be processed with use of a limited amount of internal storage..Creation of \"reduced\" files and tables is an important feature of a program; itallows the files needed only by specific phases of the program to be designed to use a relatively small amount of internal storage and input-output time..',\n",

       "  \"   The Computer Search Center (CSC) at IIT Research Institute (IITRI) providesinformation from computer-readable data bases to users in industry, governmentand universities.. The center was designed to meet user needs by providing a variety of services from multiple data bases with minimal restrictions and ahigh degree of flexibility.. A new modular machine-independent PL/1 softwaresystem was developed for handling virtually any bibliographic-type base.. CSChave run at nine different computer facilities with different: hardware,computer models, versions of OS, peripherals of the PL/1 compiler.. All databases are converted by preprocessors to a standard IITRI format which employsa directory and character string type of the structure..   User oriented profile features include: full free form Boolean logic with any degree of nesting; search terms may be any data element on a data base; search terms may be single words, multi-word terms, phrases, or term fragments;full truncation capabilities; optional sort of author, citation number, or weight; and optional printing of output on 5x8 cards, multilith masters, paper,or tape.. User aids were developed for each data base to assist in profile andmonitoring.. They include: search manuals, truncation guides, term frequency list and KLIC indexes..   Research is conducted and statistics maintained to study, monitor, and improve Center components including data bases, user satisfaction, systems,personnel functions and services..

       "  '   An evaluation of an on-line retrieval system known as EARS (Epilepsy Abstracts Retrieval System) has been performed.. The system, which permits the free text searching of approximately 8000 abstracts drawn from Epilepsy Abstracts, is supported by the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS).. Specialists in the field of neurology, at six medical centersin the United States, conducted on-line searches to satisfy their own needs for information.. Parallel searches were conducted on the same search topics by a neurologist at NINDS who was highly experienced in using the system.. The results of the original searches were evaluated in terms of recall, precision, and general user satisfaction.. A detailed analysis of factors affecting  thesuccess and failure of the on_line searches was carried out..',\n",

       "  '   The problem of selecting which journals to acquire in order to best satisfy library objectives is modeled as a zero-one linear programming problem and examined in detail.. The model incorporates an objective function based on expected usage as a measure of journal worth and cost constraints which account for the scarcity of capital.. The model can be used to aid the librarian in making better selection decisions, since the objective function can be shown to reflect the evaluation of the library as an information retrieval system and as a service organization.. Moreover, the model of seen to be related to inventory problems and scheduling models in industrial operations..    Journal usage is discussed as a measure of journal worth and is contrasted to journal productivity.. Constraints are considered for scarce resources other than capital and for journal interrelationships..',\n",

Thirty-two rules are proposedwhich could permit the automatic condensation of either of both the stored information and the question, when the concepts and relations are in the form of linear or string display..

Using a collection factor, based on 87 per cent human consistency from other courses, the computer appears then to index with 90 per cent accuracy in this case..   The technique is then used with two randomized sample document groups drawnfrom nine categories.. Each group in turn is used as the basis for indexing theother.. The computer knows only the number of categories.. After 8 cycles the computer is found to have formed 9 groups consisting of about 50 per cent of documents that were also lumped together by professional indexers on the basis of subject content..

       "  '   The cost-performance evaluation of the SUPARS system is reported.. SUPARS was an on-line, free-text bibliographic  retrieval system; cost-effectiveness data of such systems are not readily available.. In our evaluation, two measures of cost were employed: a computer processing charge expressed in dollars, and the number of documents retrieved (a measure of work that must be expended to review the retrieved items).. The measure of performance was an estimate of the recall ratio..   To obtain the requisite measures an experimental plan was developed in which experts searched the data base of Psychological Abstracts forming their queriesfrom written statements of information needs.. These statements (along with the list of documents relevant to them) were produced by people with informationproblems.. Tallies were kept of the number of documents retrieved before each of the designed relevant items were found.. The major findings are noted below..   (1) Queries to the system employing simple Boolean operators (AND, OR) havebetter cost-performance characteristics than queries using more elegant searching operators..   (2) On-demand access to the index or dictionary contributes sizeably toimproving the cost-performance of the system..   (3) The argument is raised that human factors, such as the differences amongusers of a system, probably should be a major factor in the design, operation and evaluation of retrieval systems..

       "  '   The personal literature search of a scientist is strongly governed bysubjective influences.. If he delegates his literature search he should always be aware of the problems necessarily emanating from his subjective view.. Thisprevents him from imposing unsatisfiable demands on the delegated search,particularly with respect to its expected performance, and makes him consciousof the fact that in order to satisfy his entire information need he cannot dispense with the browsing serendipity of his personal literature search.. Hewill also better understand the peculiarities of the documentary methods neededfor operating large and continuously growing systems as compared with the methods sufficient for his personal file..   The information scientist on the other hand, in charge of establishing, operating, and evaluating retrieval systems of high performance and survival power, should take into consideration the pronouncedly subjective character offundamental notions such as \"information\" and \"order\".. This gives him a betterunderstanding of the kind of inquiries submitted to him and of the inherently,even if latently, subjective character of several fundamental operations in storage and retrieval and will cause him to refrain from futile attempts to make such operations more \"objective\" and formal..

       "  '   LEADERMART is a fully operational information retrieval system featuring on-line interactive service  to a wide variety of user groups in business,industry, government, and universities.. With the availability of manycomputer-readable bibliographic data bases, experience with users dictated the development of special-purpose information products based on a thorough understanding of individual client needs, and the delivery of such products in a customized form.. Each different application required a different package, with variations of both software and data base coverage.. These packages weredeveloped via suitable modification of modular system software to result in products tailored to user idiosyncracies..   The paper describes problems associated with these repackaging procedures, and discusses the changes brought about by the introduction of an on-line, interactive retrieval service into the operating environment of users..

The method involves linking the terms relevant to any special retrieval system into the UDC, preferably in the form of the Standard ReferenceCode when it becomes available.. Links between the terms are intended to be established in such a way that, provided indexing input sessions are accomplished via a video terminal, a hybrid thesaurus-classification could be built up by a form of \"learning process\" in the course of regular indexing.. The proposed means of establishing links between terms are described, theassociated computer system is outlined, and an example of indexing languagebuilt-up procedure is presented..

The successive draftswere prepared by the Chairman and the Secretary, Mlle M.-L.Bossuat and Mlle M. Pelletier.  Probably no data element presented such a severe problem asthat of serial title.  The seemingly countless Mitteilungen,Memoires, Proceedings, Bulletins, Trudy\\'s, and the like seemed to demand some useful and standardized way to be identified.  Asolution to this problem was found in the adoption of a devicewhich consisted of marrying the author statement to the generictitle proper, with a wedding ring consisting of a space-hyphen-space and dubbing the happy couple the \"distinctive title.\"',\n",

       "  '   As the formal communication system of science has become less able tosupply information with the rapidity that scientists require, increasingattention has been paid to the structure of communication in science.. How arescientific publications utilized by scientists? What is accomplished by thecirculation of scientific information on an informal basis? How does the socialorganization among scientists facilitate or inhibit these processes?   Three types of studies have been conducted in this area: (a) studies of thescientific literature itself; (b) studies of how scientists obtain the information which they need for their research; and (c) studies of therelationship between scientists who conduct research in the same areas.. For themost part, studies of formal communication and information gathering have beenconducted in the absence of all but the most rudimentary theoretical models, ashas been pointed out in at least three recent reviews of these studies (Libbeyand Zaltman, 1967, p. 64; Paisley, 1968; Storer, 1968, p. 12).. The lack oftheory can be attributed partly to the practical orientation of many of the studies and also to the fact that an adequate model cannot be based on any oneof these types of studies alone.. A useful theory must integrate knowledge fromall three types.. In this article, we will review these studies and will describe a teoretical model which has been designed to fill this purpose..',\n",

This experiment is being conducted to identify the need for andusefulness of such services to help medical practitioners situated in isolatedareas, to assist in undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education,and to provide information precisely when and where it is needed for healthcare.

Unfilled interlibrary loansare costly to both the borrowing and the lending libraries and reduce theusefulness of the service to the reader.

Theseunfilled requests probably cost the borrowing and lendinglibraries over $400,000 in wasted manpower, besides disappointing readers who waited in vain for their materials.Much of this waste could be prevented if borrowing libraries checkin advance the lending policies before sending requests.    The major elements determining whether or not librariesreceive requests to borrow from libraries at a distance arewhether the library lists unusual materials in union lists,especially THE NATIONAL UNION CATALOG, THE UNION LIST OFSERIALS AND NEW SERIAL TITLES, and whether it has strongcollections in a subject field listed in library directories.Volume of out-of-state lending is related to the type oflending library, the size of collection, budget for current    acquisitions, number of periodicals received, photocopycharges, population density in neighboring states, proximityto other libraries, and completeness of reporting holdings inthe National Union Catalog or other bibliographic centers.',\n",

The key to this ability lies in the application of astatistical formula by which the computer calculates the degree of association between pairs of index terms.. With proper manipulation of these associations (entirely within the machine) a vocabulary of synonyms, near synonyms and otherwords closely related to any given term or group of terms is derived.. Such avocabulary related to a group of request terms is believed to be a much morepowerful tool for selecting documents from a collection than has been availableheretofore..

Most of the attention was given to the techniques which could be mechanized with a digital device such as a general purpose digital computer.. Particular was paid to techniques that could process incoming  information without prior knowledge of its existence (i.e., no tablelookups).. Thirteen basic techniques and their modifications are described..In addition, most of the techniques were tested on a sample of several thousandsubject words and several thousand proper names in order to provide a quantitative measure of comparison..',\n",

The documents are then classified into these derived categories by five subjects, and the resulting classification servesas a criterion against which the automatic classification is to be evaluated..Of the 90 documents in the validation group which contained two or more cluewords, and which therefore could be automatically classified, 44 documents, or48.9 per cent, were placed into their correct categories by use of a computer formula.. These results are almost identical to the results obtained by Maronin a previous experiment using the same data but with a different set of classification categories and a different computational formula.. The experimental evidence support the conclusion that automatic document classification is possible.. Additional experiments are described which when executed should improve the accuracy of the automatic classification technique..',\n",

It is thepurpose of this paper to report on the development of techniques for the automatic production of high quality abstracts from the full text of the original document.. It is necessary to analyze the conditions under which various methods of sentence selection are successful, in order to develop criteria for selecting sentences to form an abstract.. But clearly, an abstract can be produced by rejecting sentences of the original which are irrelevant to the abstract.. As will be seen, it is this point which is perhaps the mostsignificant contribution of this paper.. Methods of sentence selection andrejection are discussed.. These include contextual inference, intersentencereference, frequency criteria, and coherency considerations.. The automaticabstracting system we have developed consists basically of a dictionary, called the Word Control List, and of a set of rules for implementing certain functionsspecified for each WCL entry..

The notion of automated processingof natural language - i.e., machine simulation ofthe language processing activities of a human - providesnovel possibilities for interaction between linguists,who have a theoretical interest in such activities,and information scientists, who have more practicalgoals, e.g. simulating the language processing activitiesof an indexer with a machine.  The concept of a natural language information systemis introduced as a framework for reviewing automatedlanguage processing effort by computationallinguists and information scientists.  In terms of thisframework, the former have concentrated on automatingthe operations of the component for content analysisand representation, while the latter have emphasizedthe data management component.  The complementarynature of these developments allows thepostulation of an integrated approach to automatedlanguage processing.  This approach, which is outlinedin the final sections of the paper, incorporates currentnotions in linguistic theory and information science, aswell as design features of recent computational linguisticmodels.',\n",

       "  '   A decision theory approach is used to model the information retrieval decision problem of which documents to retrieve from a library collection in response to a specific user query for information.. A thorough discussion ofdecision theory, including the components of the alternatives,states-of-nature,outcomes, and evaluations - as well as of the optimization process under the cases of certainty, risk, and uncertainty - is presented.. Bayesian statisticsare also discussed to show how prior information about the various documents via classification analysis can affect the decision process under risk.. An example problem is used to illustrate the decision theory approach and tocompare tha overall performance of the retrieval system under risk with andwithout document classification information..   Thus, the operations research technique of decision theory is used to modelthe retrieval decision process, illustrate how important evaluation is, and todemonstrate the value of prior information via document classification analysis.. Moreover, the paper presents, in a somewhat tutorial mode, anoverall framework for considering the information retrieval decision problem,incorporating the aspects of cost-effectiveness and alternative evaluation,which allows one to better understand the contributions made by many researchers in this crucial area..',\n",

This study was designed to provide information needed by these three accessing services for planning future cooperative programs and for reconciling differences in policiesand practices so as to make their publications and services more useful to theiruser communities..   This paper is based on the first part of the study, which compared listings of the journals each service was routinely monitoring as of 1 May 1970.. Of the14,592 different journals monitored, 1% were monitored by all three of theservices, 27% were monitored by two of the three services, and 72% were monitored by only one of the three services.. Subsequent phases of the studywill determine the extent to which the services cover the same articles withinthe journals..',\n",

       "  '   A computer program for automatic identification of \"full form\" casecitations in legal literature (e.g., Rutherford v. Geddes, 4 Wall. 220,18 L. Ed. 343; Southland Industries, Inc. v. Federal CommunicationsCommission, 1938, 69 App. D.C., 82, 99 F.2D 117) has been developedby this group and is now operational..    The level of performance of this program known as \"The CitationIdentifier\" is high.. In a recent computer run, The CitationIdentifier scanned ther full texts of 191 randomly selected decisionsof U.S. Court of Appeals (some 400,000 words of running text) and located correctly 2,220 full-form citations out of a total of 2,227(that is, better than 99% of the total).. Only seven misses and threefalse drops occurred..   Of 2,220 full-form citations located correctly, 1944 (87%) wereidentified perfectly.. In addition, there were 276 partial identificationscontaining two types of errors:  (1) partial identifications in which somecitation terms were mistakenly lopped off by the program (\"short hits\");and (2) partial identifications that contained words improperly includedin the citations (\"long hits\").   Both types of errors are, for the most part, easily correctible andcan be largely eliminated by suitable changes in the program..   The Citation Identifier operates rather rapidly.. In a recent test run,the total time required to process some 400,000 running words of textwas approximately 15 1/2 minutes.. This speed could be further increasedby suitable changes in the computer program..   An extension of The Citation Identifier to reduced-form citations (e.g.,\"the Geddes decision\", \"the Southland Industries case\") is now in preparation..    ',\n",

       "  '   The principles underlying alerting services are discussed.. General alertingservices (as distinct from SDI systems) need to transfer to their users a large quantity of current but mainly irrelevent information as speedily as possible..As title indexes are the easiest to prepare and are therefore common, the user needs to know how much significant information is not discernible from a documents title.. This is estimated to be 20-25% but can vary with subject andtype of information sought.. If a search of, say, Chemical Titles is made,ignoring synonyms but allowing for all syntactical variants, only about onethird of the significant information will be recovered.. Synonyms and othernomenclature problems are discussed..

       "  '   Problems arising in the measurement of the rates of obsolescence of the setsof periodicals taken by special libraries are discussed.. The relatively largeerrors that arise in sampling the negative exponential distribution are analyzed because they may account for some of the discrepancies reported andbecause they indicate the need for firmer statistical control of work onobsolescence than has yet been generally appreciated..   When the rate of decline has been satisfactorily established there stillremains the problem of deciding how to apply it.. Issues of those periodicalsthat contribute most productively should be retained for a longer period thanthose of periodicals that contribute less.. To solve this problem the conceptof \"utility contours\" is introduced and exemplified in the design of a p%library..   It is argued that no discarding policy is likely to be generally applicable; every special library must be regarded as a special case.

The first group consists of 78 c-vspecialty journals, identified as cardiovascular from the title..These 78 emanate from 24 countries, with about one-half of the specialtyjournals being published by 28 national and international societies.. Thesecond group of journals is composed of those journals used by grantees ofthe National Heart Institute (NHI) to publish their findings..   In fiscal 1967, 5,860 papers, appearing in 789 journals, were reportedto NHI.. Taking the grantees of NHI as being representative of U.S.c-v researchers, it was found that the specialty journals were not themost quantitatively fertile sources of c-v information - only about 14%of American c-v papers were published there.. The remaining 86% of theliterature was widely dispersed throughout 766 nonspecialty c-v journals..   The extent of bibliographic control by the major indexing andabstracting services was found to be more extensive for the top-rankingjournals in the NHI sample than for the group of c-v specialty journals..',\n",

       "  '   The efficiency of key-work-in-context (KWIC) permuted-title indexes andtheir numerous variations is highly dependent upon authors\\' choices of titlesfor their papers.. Titles are important not only in commercial services,such as Chemical Titles, BASIC, Current Contents, and CA Condensates, butalso in scanning primary journals, and in traditional library services, suchas bibliographies.. It is generally believed and often stated that titlesof chemical papers are becoming more informative as authors becomeincreasingly aware of the importance of titles as \"carriers\" of information..The present study was undertaken to test whether (1) titles of chemical papersare becoming more informative and (2) whether uninformative titles of chemicalpapers are being eliminated since the advent of the KWIC index in 1958..   The first hypothesis was tested by comparing titles published in 1948, 1958, and 1968 by the following criteria: (1) a count of substantive wordsin the title; (2) a count of all word matches between title and 10 leadingsubstantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of athesaurus; and (3) a count of word matches between title and 10 leadingsubstantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use ofa thesaurus.. The second hypothesis was tested by comparing a count ofshort titles (with 3 or less substantive words) published in 1948, 1958,and 1968..   Results confirm that uninformative titles of chemical papers arebeing eliminated and that informative titles are becoming more informativesince the advent of the KWIC index..  ',\n",

The similarities between the indexing process and the generalcommunication process are discussed, and indexing is viewed as an order increasing (i.e., entropy decreasing) operation.. The concept of a theoreticalindex is developed and contrasted with real-world indexing systems..

       "  \"  Let me remind you of that famous place in Dickins'Pickwick Papers where we hear of a researcher whocomposed a copious review on Chinese Metaphysics withthe aid only of the Encyclopedia Britannica, whichcontained absolutely no information on that subject.The technique used, we are told with a nudge ofsuperiority, was to read for metaphysics under theletter M, and for China under the letter C, and tocombine the information.  I feel that we may be performing just such a miracleof creative juxtaposition when we assume that ScientificInformation is just some special variety of informationthat contains queer words like Potassium Permanganate,pi r squared, and numbers like 2.71828.  We suppose toothat Scientific Libraries are just libraries that happen to befull of scientific books, and that the best possibletechnical librarian would be somebody who had picked up alibrary qualification and combined it with the appropriatesort of technical qualification.  There is, as they used tosay, no mixture of ingredients but a genuine chemicalcompound.  I wish to point out two simple facts:  there ismore to scholarship than the mere cumulation, storage and retrieval of information, and there is about scienceand technology something intrinsically different frommere scholarship.\",\n",

       "  '   ELMS (Experimental Library Management System) is an experimentalsystem for total library management, operating on-line with an IBM 360through IBM 2260 and 2741 terminals.. The system is designed to handlelarge amounts of highly variable information which it processes on command, giving on-line computer service for all library operations..At the same time, it must accommodate the different needs and skillsof a broad range of library users, from new patrons to well-trainedlibrarians..   Such a system presents programming problems that will be typicalof large, interactive computer systems in the seventies.. This paperdiscusses ELMS features that facilitate user interaction, and may proveuseful in similar systems:  techniques for tutoring the user (displayformat, one-question, one-answer displays, and KWIC indexing); adaptabilityfor the experienced user (command chains and a standard set of four-lettermnemonic codes for higher-level control); minimization of keying (linenumbers, one-character mnemonic codes used with procedures, and use ofdefault conditions); performance of clerical tasks by exception notification;and collection of operational statistics to help improve the system..',\n",

       "  '   Interactive systems, in existence for nearly 15 years, are becomingincreasingly important, both for information retrieval and library supportoperations.. The virtues of these systems are speed, intimacy, and -if time-sharing is involved - economy.. The major problems are the cost ofthe large computers and files necessary for bibliographic data, the still-high cost of communications, and the generally poor design of the user-system interfaces.. The desirable features of on-line retrieval interfacesare only now being defined and tested in a systematic way, e.g., by theNational Library of Medicine in its AIM-TWX nationwide experimentalretrieval service.. System implementers must, in addition to engineeringthe right capabilities into on-line systems, also make a careful, concerted effort to engineer user acceptance.. Common pitfalls hereinclude overselling system capabilities and failure to take into accountthe social context around the user terminal.. The major national problemis to avoid or limit wasteful and expensive duplication in providingnationwide search access to the hundreds of public and private databases that will be readily available during the next few years..

       "  '   A variety of aspects related to testing of retrieval systems wereexamined.. A model of a retrieval system, together with a set of measuresand a methodology for performance testing were developed.. In the mainexperiment the effect on performance of the following variableswas tested:  sources of indexing, indexing languages, coding schemes,question analyses, search strategies and formats of output.. Inaddition, a series of separate experiments was carried out to investigatethe problems of controls in experimentation with IR systems.. The mainconclusions:  the human factor appears to be the main variable in allcomponents of an IR system; length of indexes affects performanceconsiderably more than indexing languages; question analyses and searchstrategies to affect performance to a great extent - as much, if not  morethan indexing.. Retrieval systems seem to be able to perform at present onlyon a general level, failing to be at the same time comprehensive and specific..It seems that testing of total IR systems controlling and monitoring allfactors (environmental and systems-related) is not possible at present..

       "  '   Though the idea of constructing a keyword classification for retrievalpurposes automatically is not a new one, comparatively few systematicexperiments have been carried out in this area; and while many suggestionshave been put forward, not enough is known about the behaviour of automatickeyword classifications, and hence about the properties such classificationsshould have and the ways they should be used.. In previous experiments weshowed that some forms of classification could give good results, and thispaper describes a further series of tests designed to examine this sort ofclassification in more detail, with a view to establishing the optimum formsof classification and procedures for using them in different retrieval situations.. These tests demonstrate that further improvements in performance over that for unclassified keywords can be obtained, and thatdefinite conclusions can be drawn about the correct approach to classificationfor collections like the test one: the best results are given when groupingis confined to strongly connected, nonfrequent keywords, when the classification is used to provide additional rather than alternative indexingterms, particularly for requests, and when matching is controlled by keywordfrequency..',\n",

To fulfill this responsibility, questionnaires were developed to elicitreliable information concerning courses being offered relatingto information storage and retrieval, informationscience and/or documentation.  The data requestedincluded course levels, pre- and post-requisite courses,textbooks used, topics covered, frequency with whichoffered, etc.  Responses were received from 45 schools, providinginformation about 185 courses and 242 topics.  Usingseveral methods of clustering the data, it was difficultto arrive at firm results, because of the diversity andscatter of the topics included in this field.  It wastherefore decided to hold a workshop of experts whichwould examine the validity of the questionnaire results.  This workshop, using the Delphi technique to arriveat consensus, was held at the University of Pittsburghon September 21-23, 1970.  Sixteen specialists in thefield representing universities industry and governmentwere brought together to participate.  Consensus wasreached in identifying nine factors which contribute tothe curriculum in information science and seven courseswhich constitute the core for the Master's program.The topics to be included in each of these courses werealso isolated.\",\n",

       "  \"   Compound words cause some difficulty in post-coordinate indexingsystems:  if too many are fractured, or the wrong categories are selectedfor fracturing, noise will be produced at unacceptable levels on retrieval..Various prior suggestions for handling compound terms are examined whichinclude those for pre-coordinated or rotated, indexes..   The syntactic origins are also explored and it is found that manycompound words hinge on a prepositional relationship between the components,and that this relationship can be applied to decision making.. Othercompound words are in effect abbreviated statements from longer phrases, while some are influenced by the presence of a verb-like form..   These syntactic influences, together with some of the philosophy fromearlier studies - especially that of the 'force' required to fracture aterm, have been combined to produce a set of rules which have beenemployed at the National Rubber Producers' Research Association (NRPRA)for over two years.. These have greatly eased decision making and haveenabled the thesaural vocabulary to be made more consistent..   It is also suggested that the rules have some bearing on theapplication of roles especially if these are employed on a pre-coordinatebasis..\",\n",

       "  ' Miller, William L.',\n",
       "  '   Previous research has indicated that the titles rather than index terms would, in the standard MEDLARS system, gave lower Recall but higher Precision..A title searching technique is described which allows the number of referencesretrieved to be fixed before a search commences.. With this technique thegreater applicability of title-terms offsets their relative paucity.. Thetitle-searching technique is tested using queries put to MEDLARS.. These queries were not specially solicited for the test.. Title searching is comparedwith the standard MEDLARS index term search and with an index term search with fixed output size.. For equal output sizes, Title searching retrieves 4 relevant references for every 5 retrieved by index term searching.. Thus the relative retrieval efficiency of Title and Index terms is so close that the choice of one method or the other must be primarily on economic grounds..',\n",

       "  ' Thompson, David A., Ph.D.',\n",
       "  \"   This article focuses on the human interaction characteristics of aninformation retrieval system, suggests some design considerations toimprove man-machine cooperation, and describes a research system at Stanford that is exploring some of these techniques..   Librarians can only be of limited assistance in helping the naiveuser formulate an unstructured feeling in his mind into an appropriatesearch query that maps into the retrieval system.. Consequently, theprocess of query formulation by the user, interactively with theinformation available in te system, remains one of the principalproblems in information retrieval today..   In an attempt to solve this problem by improving the interfacecommunication between man and the computer, we have pursued theobjective of displaying hierarchically structured index trees on a CRTin a decision tree format permitting the user merely to point (with alight pen) at alternatives which seem most appropriate to him.. Usinghis passive rather than his active vocabulary expands his interactionvocabulary by at least an order of magnitude.. Moreover, a hierarchically displayed index is a modified thesaurus, and may beaugmented by adding lateral links to provide semantic assistance tothe user..

       "  '   A new testing process is described designed to compare conventional retrieval(MEDLARS) and automatic text analysis methods (SMART).. The results obtained with a collection of documents chosen independently of either SMART or MEDLARSindicate that a simple automatic extraction of keywords from document abstractsproduces a 30 to 40 percent loss compared with MEDLARS indexing.. A replacementof the unranked Boolean searches used in MEDLARS by the standard ranked output normally provided by SMART reduces the loss to between 15 and 20 percent.. Whenautomatically generated word control list or a thesaurus is used as part of the SMART analysis, the results are comparable in effectiveness to those obtained by the intellectual MEDLARS indexing.. Finally, the incorporation of user feedback procedures into SMART furnishes an improvement over the normal MEDLARS output of 15 to 30 percent..    One concludes again that no technical justification exists for maintaining controlled, manual indexing in operational retrieval environments..',\n",

       "  \" The Development of a Semantic Differential to Assess Users' Attitudes Towards An On-line Interactive Reference Retrieval System\",\n",
       "  ' Katzer, Jeffrey',\n",
       "  '   A semantic differential (SD) is a commonly used instrument which canbe used to reliably measure attitude toward a variety of objects orconcepts.. Each SD consists of a series of bipolar adjective scales onwhich a respondent reacts, in relation to the object or concept of interest..To interpret completed SDs, it simplifies the procedures and aids in thedevelopment of theory if the adjective scales are grouped into one or moreindependent clusters.. The primary purpose of this study was to identifythose clusters (or dimensions) applied by a user of an on-line user-orientedreference retrieval system when he reacts toward such a system..   Seventy-one who used or were familiar with a working on-line referenceretrieval system completed a packet of 20 SDs, each consisting of the same19 adjective scales.. The correlations among the scales were factor analyzed.. Three independent dimensions were identified.. Factor I was labeled \"evaluative-specific\" and accounted for over 23% of the totalvariance.. Factor II was called \"desirability\"; it accounted for over 17% of the total variance.. And, Factor III, entitled \"enormity\" accountedfor over 10% of the total variance.. Another analysis showed the factorstructure to be highly reliable.. Therefore, if the derived threedimensional structure underlies users\\' attitudes toward a more generalclass of retrieval systems, then undimensional or unstructured systemevaluation of users\\' attitudes will be simplistic and possibly misleading..   In order to construct a working semantic differential, 10 adjectivescales were identified which best represented the three dimensions..Brief instructions are included which outline how to use this SD..The discussion is mainly concerned with the obtained factor structureand the need for a predicative replication of the study..

To have a widespread impact,an on-line system must compete successfully with a multitude of other sourcesof references..

       "  '   In an attempt to further amplify the characteristics of the cardiovascularserial literature, citation patterns were studied.. As previously shown, one-third of the 5,860 papers from the National Heart Institute grantees for1967 appeared within 13 journals (3).. After the exclusion of the abstractjournals, the remaining journals were used to obtain a basic pool of 300cardiovascular related articles.. Science Citation Index was used togather statistics relative to citing author, journal and year.. The 300articles in the basic pool were cited a total of 2,545 times during thisfour-year period (1967-1970).. The figures concerning citation rate byyear serve to uphold the idea that journal citation reaches a peak duringthe third year after publication.. Also some definite patterns of self-citationwere noted.. It was found that, when analyzed on the basis of first author, 15 percent of the 2,545 citations were self-citations.. The ten basic journals tend to be cited mostly within themselves; one-third of thecitations were found in these journals.. Although the citations werefound throughout 349 journals, indicating an extensive scatter, arelatively high percentage of papers were found in few journals..',\n",

The findings are based uponan analysis of actual use data recorded from all volumes and issues left bylibrary users on study tables and on trucks in the photocopy area fromMarch 15 to June 31, 1971.. The Science Library contains some 220 physicsjournals.. The study reveals that only 138 journals (62.7%) were used evenonce during the 3 1/2-month interval.. A core of 49 journals supplies 90%of use, and these items would cost 51.1% of the total single subscriptioncosts of the 138 used titles:  52.3% of use occurs in journal volumes lessthan 6 years old.. English is the most used language of physics journals andthe English journals account for 95.3% of use..

       "  '   This paper develops a mathematical model for use in studying how to minimize the cost of operating a mechanized retrieval system.. Through the use of cost analysis, the model provides a method for comparativeevaluation between information retrieval systems.. The cost model divides thecosts of a retrieval system into two components:  system costs and user costs..In addition, it suggests that a trade off exists between the performancelevel of the system and the combination of user and systems time that isexpended in working with the system..

The system allows real-time display and updating ofall elements of the file.. Consequently all check-in, bindery, and claimsoperations, as well as new entries and data field changes are accomplishedon a real-time basis.. All programs are in PL/1.. Required equipment is anIBM time-shared facility with 100 K memory available for the applicationsprograms, and IBM 2260 display units..   This article is the first of three..

The JCI consists of a journal byjournal tabulation of citings to and from each journal in the index..A large amount of consistency was found between the citing characteristicsof the journals in the different scientific fields, with quite clearboundaries between fields and a few well known cross disciplinaryjournals as cross field information links..The separate disciplines appear to relate to each other in an orderlymanner, with a natural sequence:  mathematics --> physics --> chemistry -->biochemistry --> biology..

       "  '   A taxonomy for modeling information systems is presented.. The taxonomyderives from the history of modern epistemology.. Epistemology is used as aprescriptive modeling basis because (1) the fundamental problems of epistemology are concerned with information, and (2), because the history ofepistemology identifies any archetypal ways that men have conceived ofinformation and of models..   It is shown how the different models of epistemology can be madescientifically operational through the use of a special kind of systemsanalysis..   Finally, the results of a preliminary experiment based on one of the modelsare presented in the form of prescriptive rules for the design of futureexperiments.. ',\n",

       "  '   It was argued that the present-day thesaurus-construction and maintenancerules and conventions are not theoretically based.. For this reason, thereare few rules and conventions for updating a thesaurus.. Consequently, most of the thesauri adopted by operating information storage andretrieval systems are not systematically updated.. In order to investigate how thesauri are actually updated, a survey was conducted.. The working hypothesis was that the communication process between authorsand readers is linear in nature (\"one-way\" communication allowing no reciprocal feedback) if a thesaurus utilized in a system is not updatedby both indexers and question negotiators.. Findings show that thesauriviewed from the communications point of view do not allow a cyberneticprocess of communication (\"both-way\" communication).. The surveyindicated that the present practice of updating thesauri is largelydone by indexers alone.. No attempt was made to develop a theory ofthesaurus construction and updating.. It was, however, argued thatsuch a theory, if developed, should at least account for the conceptsof meaning and knowledge.. Within this theoretical framework, twotechniques are suggested to be considered for the systematic updatingof a thesaurus..',\n",

       "  ' Jones, Kevin P.',\n",
       "  \"   It has been suggested that information science is still of the stageof alchemy:  if this is so then mutual exclusivity must form itsphilosopher's stone.. Mutual exclusivity appears to be alien to theobservable universe:  that this is so is displayed through a series ofexamples.. Some of these relate to everyday things like trees, beachesand man himself,  whilst others relate to more obscure phenomena likecontinental drift and black holes.. The act of observation is alsoconsidered as this has a considerable bearing on the problem..   Nevertheless, mutual exclusivity must form part of man's mentalpowers and this has found expression in the relatively exclusiveseries of symbols used in communication.. The dangers of exclusivethinking in relation to environmental problems are considered, andthis results in a paradox which is probably unresolvable..

       "  \"   The philosophy of a systems approach to the design of informationstorage and retrieval systems is suggested in which the computer isrecognized in its proper perspective as a powerful and effectivealternative tool.. This philosophy is in contrast to a prevalentphilosophy of the '60's in which many information systems designerstouted the computer as the answer to all information storage andretrieval situations.. Important principles of information systemdesign incorporated within the framework of the novel philosophyfor the '70's are presented.. These are:  the performance of users'needs studies by the representative small group technique; theanalysis of users' needs including their rank ordering by priority; the selection and adaptation for a specific application of a suitableexistent information storage and retrieval system from those available; the involvement of potential users in the system design by establishinga model with which they can interact and provide feedback; and the finaldesign of a cost-effective system.. A number of pitfalls arising fromearlier design methodologies are pointed out, and the avoidance of thesepitfalls by adopting a true systems approach is discussed.. \",\n",

       "  \"   It was argued in Part I (see JASIS, March-April 1973 p. 87) that the bestway to evaluate a retrieval system is, in principle at least, to elicitsubjective estimates of the system's utility to its users, quantified interms of the numbers of utilities (e.g. dollars) they would have been willingto give up in exchange for the privilege of using the system; and a naivemethodology was outlined for evaluating retrieval systems on this basis..But the impracticality of the naive evaluation procedure as it stands raisesthe questions:\\tHow can one decide which practical measure is likely toyield results most closely resembling those of the naive methodology? Andhow can one tell whether the resemblance is close enough to make applyingthe measure worth while? In the present paper two kinds of solution tothese problems are taken up.. The first answers the questions in termsof the reasonableness of the simplifying assumptions needed to get fromthe naive measure to the proposed substitute.. The second answers it byexperimentation..\",\n",

       "  '   Some new text searching retrieval techniques are described which retrievenot documents but sentences from documents and sometimes (on occasionsdetermined by the computer) multi-sentence sequences.. Since the goal of thetechniques is retrieval of answer-providing documents, \"answer-passages\" areretrieved.. An \"answer-passage\" is a passage which is either answer-providingor \"answer-indicative,\" i.e., it permits inferring that the document containing it is answer-providing.. In most cases answer-sentences, i.e., single-sentence answer-passages, are retrieved.. This has great advantagesfor screening retrieval output..   Two new automatic procedures for measuring closeness of relationbetween clue words in a sentence are described.. One approximatessyntactic closeness by counting the number of intervening \"syntacticjoints\" (roughly speaking, prepositions, conjunctions and punctuationmarks) between successive clue words.. The other measure uses wordproximity in a new way.. The two measures perform about equally well..   The computer uses \"enclosure\" and \"connector words\" for determiningwhen a multi-sentence passage should be retrieved.. However, no procedurewas found in this study for retrieving multi-paragraph answer-passages, which were the only answer-passages occurring in 6% of the papers..   In a test of the techniques they failed to retrieve two answer-providing documents (7% of those to be retrieved) because ofone multi-paragraph answer-passage and one complete failureof clue word selection.. For the other answer-providing documents theyretrieved at all recall levels with greater precision than SMART, which has produced the best previously reported recall-precision results..   The retrieval questions (mostly from real users) and documents used inthis study were from the field of information science.. The results of thestudy are surprisingly good for retrieval in such a \"soft science,\" andit is reasonable to hope that in less \"soft\" sciences and technologiesthe techniques described will work even better.. On this basis a dissemination and retrieval system of the near future is predicted..',\n",

There is no evidence for synchronousobsolescence in the 1955 to 1968 volumes of these journals: instead there issome statistically significant evidence of greater density of use withgreater age.. Similar evidence elsewhere is cited.. The ranking order forheaviness of use is also radically altered by converting raw frequenciesto densities of use..

I must begin bysaying that I do take information science seriously as a science.. I seeit as the quest for understanding of the nature of information andman\\'s interaction with it.. That we lack so much in this quest forunderstanding is the greatest challenge of the science..   I intend to explore the tradition, or world view, bearing on thescientific study of information.. The currently prevalent world view isthe scientific tradition which extends from the Enlightenment tothe present.. I also intend to look critically at what I perceiveto be te premises underlying most of our current efforts to understandthe phenomenon of information..

       "  '   Successful information retrieval from a mechanized file is heavilydependent on the fidelity of the representation of concepts in theparticular language of the system and on the predictability of thisrepresentation..    If an index language is employed, predictability is guaranteed andthe quality of the retrieval is predominantly governed by the fidelityof the representation, i.e., by the extent to which conceptualdistortion of the concepts to be represented can be avoided.. The variousindex languages vary widely with respect to their fidelity.. Differencesin their performance are correspondingly great..   The lack of fidelity in most of the present day indexing languagesis due mainly to insufficient representation of the relationshipsamong concepts.. We describe a new graphical method of storing andretrieving concept relations of various kinds.. The points of such agraph are occupied by concepts, and the connecting lines between thesepoints represent concept relations.. In a special field of chemistry,these graphs also serve as a kind of presentation of the essentials of adocument to the reader that is much more lucid than a natural languagetext..  ',\n",

       "  '   A good deal of work has been done over the years in an attempt to use statistical or probabilistic techniques as a basis of automatic indexing andcontent analysis..    Unfortunately, many of these methods are lacking in effectiveness, and themore refined procedures are computationally unattractive..   A new technique, known as discrimination value analysis, ranks the text words in accordance with how much they are able to discriminate the documentsof a collection from each other; that is, the value of a term depends on howmuch the average separation between individual documents changes when the given term is assigned for content identification.. The best words are those whichachieve the greatest separation..    The discrimination value analysis is computationally simple, and it assigns a specific role in content analysis to single words, juxtaposed words and phrases, and word groups or thesaurus categories..  Experimental results are given showing the effectiveness of the technique..',\n",

       "  '   The indexing of a document is among the most crucial steps in preparing that document for retrieval.. The adequacy of the indexing determines the ability of the system to respond to patron requests.. This paper discusses this process,and document retrieval in general, on the basis of formal decision theory.. Thebasic theoretical approach taken is illustrated by means of a model of word occurrences in documents in the context of a model information system; both models are fully defined in this paper.. Though the main purpose of this paperis to provide insights into a very complex process, formulae are developed that may prove to be of value for an automated operating system..The paper concludeswith an interpretation of recall and precision curves as seen from the point of view of decision theory..',\n",

In Part I of the study, a mixture of two Poisson distributions is examined in detail as a model of specialty word distribution, and formulasexpressing the three parameters of the model in terms of empiricalfrequency statistics are derived.. The fit of the model is tested on anexperimental document collection and found to be acceptable for thepurposes of the study.. A measure intended to identify specialty words, consistent with the 2-Poisson model, is proposed and evaluated..',\n",

Relevance is considered as a measure of the effectiveness of a contact between a source and a destination in a communication process.. The different views of relevance that emerged areinterpreted and related within a framework of communication of knowledge..Different views arose because relevance was considered at a number of different points in the process of knowledge communication..

       "  '   This paper reports on a novel technique for literature indexing andsearching in a mechanized library system.. The notion of relevance is takenas the key concept in the theory of information retrieval and a comparativeconcept of relevance is explicated in terms of the theory of probability.. The resulting technique called \"Probabilistic Indexing,\" allows a computingmachine, given a request for information, to make a statistical inferenceand derive a number (called the \"relevance number\") for each document, whichis a measure of the probability that the document will satisfy the given requestranked according to their probable relevance..   The paper goes on to show that whereas in a conventional librarysystem the cross-referencing (\"see\" and \"see also\") is based solely onthe \"semantical closeness\" between index terms, statistical measures ofcloseness between index terms can be defined and computed.. Thus, givenan arbitrary request consisting of one (or many) index term(s), a machinecan elaborate on it to increase the probability of selecting relevantdocuments that would not otherwise have been selected..

       "  '   The statistical approach to the analysis of document collections andretrieval therefrom has proceeded along two main lines, associative machinesearching and automatic classification.. The former approach has beenfavored because of the tendency of people in the computer field to strive fornew methods of dealing with the literature--methods which do not resemble thoseof traditional libraries.. But automatic classification study also has beenthriving; some of the reasons for this are discussed..   The crucial question of the quality of automatic classification is treatedat considerable length, and empirical data are introduced  to support thehypothesis that classification quality improves as more information abouteach document is used for input to the classification program.. Sixnonjudgmental criteria are used in testing the hypothesis for 100keyword lists (each list representing a document) for a series of computerruns in which the number of words per document is increased progressivelyfrom 12 to 36.. Four of the six criteria indicate the hypothesis holds, andtwo point to no effect.. Previous work of this kind has been confined to therange of one through eight words per document..   Finally, the future of automatic classification and some of the practicalproblems to be faced are outlined..      ',\n",

       "  \"   The retrieval of documented information is one of today's most widespreadtechnical problems, affecting almost every large professional group, corporation, and government bureau.. Because document retrieval is in part aninformation processing problem, much hope for a solution has vested in computers.. But large, fast, reliable ones have been around now for five year, and people have steadily realized that the over-all task of information retrieval is not one of those rote jobs for which digital computers are made toorder.. Cataloging and searching are intellectual tasks, and have been thoughtof as rote not because they are menial and straightforward, but because theyare unpalatable and unwanted.. Many people do like to use their minds, yes -but not for plowing through and discarding irrelevant material..   Many people have assumed that this would also be the case in informationretrieval.. Accordingly, the rush to put computers to work in this area has ledprimarily to their use as searching instruments, and much activity has centeredaround the design and operation of searching machinery..  Boundary conditions have been assumed, such as an ideal searcher who knows what he wants and whoknows how to express it in terms understood by the machine, and such as idealcorrespondence of descriptors to the documents they describe; then attention has been focused on optimizing the processes between these boundaries.. Theresulting theories and systems in most cases seem highly adapted to the needsof machine but not adapted to the needs of humans..   We are, after all, dealing with the elemental situation of an author talkingto a reader - even if by means of a buffer storage which will grow more andmore mechanical.. The basic problem is to increase the mental contact betweenthe reader and the information store, so that the reader can proceed unerringlyand swiftly to identify and receive the message he is looking for..\",\n",

       "  '  This paper describes new methods of automatically extracting documents forscreening purposes, i.e. the computer selection of sentences having thegreatest possible potential for conveying to the reader the substance ofthe document.  While previous work has focused on one component of sentencesignificance, namely, the presence of high-frequency content words (key words),the methods described here also treat three additional components: pragmaticwords (cue words); title and heading words; and structural indicators (sentencelocation).  The research has resulted in an operating system and a research methodology.The extracting system is parameterized to control and vary the influence ofthe above four components.  The research methodology includes procedures forthe compilation of the required dictionaries, the setting of the controlparameters, and the comparative evaluation of the automatic extracts withmanually produced extracts.  The results indicate that the three newly proposedcomponents dominate the frequency component in the production of better extracts.

A chemist does not think of a chemical, for example,ethyl alcohol, in isolation.  Ethyl alcohol is not merelya word or a term without dimensions to a chemist.  Itis a concept that he associates with or relates to aproduct, a reactant, a solvent in a reaction, a use, aproperty, etc.  It is within the semantics of hisconceptual needs that he would like to use an index to retrieve those documents he needs.  He wants more thandocuments, however, from the index.  He wants the indexto direct him to those documents which are pertinentto his problem.  He wants the index to help him togenerate thoughts and to suggest new combinations.He wants the index to help him in terms of his language,logic, and semantics and through a generic or specific approach, whichever occurs to him first.  He wants theability to browse among the terms to discover the termthat is on the tip of his tongue or recessed in hismemory.

       "  '  The objective of the Computer Search Center (CSC) of the Information Sciencessection of IIT Research Institute (IITRI) is to provide a link between a widevariety of users and the rapidly expanding information resources in machine-readable form.  Because none of the available computer search programs metthe criteria of the center, and because of the need to handle a variety of databases, new general purpose computer programs were written, and a tape formatwas developed so that a wide variety of data bases can be searched by the samecomputer program.  The center was designed to provide current awareness andretrospective search services from both document-type and data-type computerizeddata files.  The desire to develop transferable programs for use at manyinstallations prompted the adoption of the machine-independent compiler language PL/1 and the use of IBM 360 series computers.  The objective of education and training led to the development of a \"Search Manual\" for profilepreparation, the development of a workbook in \"Modern Techniques in ChemicalInformation,\" the teaching of a new academic course, and the presentation ofseminars.',\n",

A strategy which takesaccount of the disparate frequencies of the various species of fragmentsin a data-base by use of differential, and, in part, hierarchical levels ofdescription is detailed.  The distributions of a variety of structuralcharacteristics, including bond-centered, atom-centered, and ring fragmentsin a 30,000-compound sample of the Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Systemare summarized.

       "  '  Index names for chemical substances have been significantly revised byChemical Abstracts Service (CAS) for Volume 76 [January-June 1972, the firstvolume of the Ninth Collective Period (1972-1976)] and subsequent volumes ofChemical Abstracts.  While remaining generally within the framework of IUPACand other existing nomenclature rules, the most systematic recommended nameshave been chosen.  These names are more easily derived from molecular structuraldiagrams, and, therefore, are more quickly found by index users.  Machineediting of index names and translation of these names into structuralrepresentations in the CAS computer-based information system are also aidedby the revisions.  The index name revisions include (i) conversion of almost all\"trivial\" or author terminology into more systematic names, (ii) simplificationof general name-selection rules, and (iii) elimination of special treatment forcertain classes of substances.  Specific identifiable alloys, elementaryparticles, enzymes, and mixtures of substances are now indexed like conventionalchemical substances.  Difficulties encountered with generation of previousChemical Abstracts index names and indexing rules are described, and comparisonsare made of new and former index names for chemical compounds and substituentradicals.',\n",

Over-all analysisof the performance suggests that an effective data base can be created byaugmenting the CA Condensates data base with Registry Numbers and somerepresentation of the CAISF General Subject concept headings, which resultsin a file approximately half the size of the corresponding CAISF data baseand is suitable for search using existing retrieval system software.',\n",

       "  '  There are many chemical retrieval systems whichprocess the first type of request efficiently.  Most of thesesystems are also capable of handling certain fragmentrequests; however, the fragments which can be processedare frequently of a restricted nature.  For example, inretrieval systems which are based on linear ciphers, onlythose fragments which are explicit in the cipher arereadily detected.  To allow a completely general specification of fragments it seems inevitable that adetailed atom-by-atom comparison is required of the queryand library structures.  A technique for making such detailedcomparisons is presented in this report.  This techniqueis novel in that it avoids the excessive backtracking adrestarting required by other atom-by-atom matchingprocedures.  Before giving the details of the proposed algorithm,some definitions are reviewed and a brief example ispresented to illustrate the over-all concepts.  Then the flowdiagram of the algorithm is explained in terms of additionalexamples.  Finally, the mechanization of the algorithm fora digital computer is discussed.  This report is a condensed version of the original, whichgives a generalization and comprehensive description ofthe algorithm, proofs of convergence and related topics,and applications other than chemical retrieval systems.',\n",

       "  '  The Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Chemical Registry System is a computer-based system that uniquely identifies chemical substances on the basis ofcomposition and structure.  Since initial operation in 1964 as a stand-aloneinput, storage, and retrieval system for structural representations of organicchemical compounds, the scope of the CAS Registry System has steadily increasedto include all types of chemical substances and the entire system has beenintegrated into CAS indexing operations.  The third refinement of this system,Registry III, which has been in operation for over a year, involves majorchanges in Registry recods but no change in the basic algorithmic techniquesfor registering chemical substances.  The previous format for listing atoms and bonds has been modified so that each ring system is now separately identified, and this ring-system identifier is used in the record for eachsubstance that contains that ring.  These modifications support CAS nomenclaturederivation and also a computer-based structure output system.  The generaldesign of Registry III, which involves a structure record of cyclic and acyclicsegments, is presented.',\n",

Little attention has been paid to the behavior of thescientist (chemist) toward the learning process and the role of the literaturein that learning process.  The ACS has gained some insight into this behaviorand thus urges caution before one leaps to the uncritical conclusion thatthe literature as now constituted is dead but has not yet fallen over.  Whatseems more likely, when human behavior patterns are considered, is that thenew and the old will co-exist side by side for several generations, and thatthe system's current emphasis on completeness will be replaced with selectivecompression. \",\n",

These are attributed to the fact that as the literature hasexpanded, the needs of both authors and readers are no longer being met byprinting and distributing all of the material accepted to all subscribers.A two-edition system is proposed, with short versions of papers in a broadcirculation issue and expanded versions, including full details and discussion, in library-circulation microfilm editions.  Reactions of chemists to sucha system are discussed.  It is recommended that two-edition journals bedeveloped in a evolutionary way by increasing use of the ACS mcirofilm editions for sections of articles and for supplementary documents to accompanycommunications.

       "  '  The academic users of the bibliographic information dissemination centerwere surveyed to determine the ways in which the search results were beingused, the impact which the services had had on professional activities suchas research and instruction, the interface between the computer-basedretrieval and the traditional form of library resources, and the effect ofdocument overlap between different data bases.  The survey results indicatethat the dissemination services are being used by a large portion of thefaculty and the graduate students within the University System of Georgia,with an average of 3 to 5 people seeing the bibliography from each searchquestion.  Over 97% of the respondees indicated some or substantialcontribution to their professional activities, with the major contributions being a savings or more efficient use of time and broadened subjectcoverage.  The users indicated several changes in library use habits as aresult of the computer-based searches, among them more direct access to theprimary literature and increased use of library resources as they had beenmade aware of new sources and media - e.g., microforms.

       "  '  The Index Chemicus Registry System (ICRS) is themachine-readable equivalent of Current Abstracts inChemistry & Index Chemicus (CAC & IC).  In an earlierpaper, we described the development of an experimentalselective-dissemination-of-information (SDI) servicebased on these tapes.  A detailed description of thetechniques of profile construction for searching aWiswesser Line Notation (WLN) structure file is given inthis earlier paper.  The present paper describes the evaluationof the SDI service in terms both of quantitative measuresof retrieval performance, coverage and currency, and also ofuser reactions to the service, as expressed in their repliesto a questionnaire.  Failure analysis techniques were used toidentify the reasons for retrieval failures and possiblemethods for improving retrieval performance.  A fullerdescription of the evaluation has been published in reportform.',\n",

       "  \"  The purpose of this paper is to present up-to-datematerial to indicate some of the changes that have takenplace during and since World War II.  For purposes ofcomparison, the work of Patterson and Sheppard isrepresented in abbreviated form in Tables 1 and 2.  Theresults of our own study are presented as Tables 3 and 4.The reader can draw several obvious conclusions.  Abouthalf of all the citations in Tables 3 and 4 are to paperspublished in the 1950's.  This, in part, reflects thepresent highly vigorous state of chemical investigationand its rapid expansion in recent years.  Another strikingfact is that in the Journal of the American ChemicalSociety, 39.5% of the citations are to previous workpublished in the journal itself.  In Industrial andEngineering Chemistry, the percentage of self citationsis 21.3.  To some extent this may result from the factthat writers who habitually publish in a particularjournal tend to cite their own work.  However, it seemsto reflect to a greater degree the dominance of thesejournals in their respective fields.

       "  '  In 1971 the Committee on Chemical Information of theNational Academy of Sciences, National Research Council,recognized the problem of large data bases and accordinglycreated a subcommittee to investigate the problem and itsimpact on chemical information.  The first task of the Large Data Base Subcommittee wasto survey organizations that generate and/or process largedata bases.  Giering has indicated several different ways inwhich one can view a data base as being large.  It can belarge in terms of having a large number of entries orrecords (or bibliographic references).  It can be large inthe sense of having a large number of fields or dataelements, which implies a degree of complexity.  It can bethought of as large in the sense of having a large numberof searchable or selectable elements, and it also can belarge in the most readily understandable sense of havinga large number of characters in storage.',\n",

       "  '  This paper first presents a brief tutorial on the principal random fileorganization methods for handling two major applications - Transactionoriented systems and Information storage and retrieval systems.  It thenaddresses a particular large data base dilemma, not satisfactorilyresolved by any of these methods, and which is currently under activeinvestigation.  Two approaches to a solution are described.  One iscalled the hybrid inverted list; the other is based upon an old techniquecalled super-imposed coding.  The former has been implemented and has recently been installed in an operational system.  Some statistics relatedto file characteristics in this application are provided, but operationalcost and performance statistics are not yet available.',\n",

       "  '  The increasing availability of computer-readable files of chemical  nomenclature and of programs for text searching has led to the developmentof methods for performing substructure searches in which CA nomenclatureterms are used as search terms.  Substructure searches on CA Indexnomenclature can often result in very high recall relative to topologicalsearches, as is shown by experimental results achieved on a variety ofsearches.  Many data bases which contain CA Index nomenclature also containnonsubstance data.  Thus, searching of substance and nonsubstance datacan often be done within a single search of a file with both high recalland relevancy.  Profile construction aids prepared by CAS make it possiblefor persons without sophisticated nomenclature backgrounds to constructnomenclature profiles for many questions.',\n",

Of the 73 replies, 49.3% indicated useof such services, while 24.6% were planning to use them primarily by facultyand graduate students.. Of those reporting, 83.3% used searchers with a background in library or information science; 47.2% had a background in scientific discipline..Two or more on-line services were used by 72.2%..

       "  ' A Fuzzy-Set-Theoretic Interpretation of Linguistic Hedges',\n",
       "  ' Zadeh, L. A.',\n",
       "  '   A basic idea suggested in this paper is that a linguistic hedge such as very, more or less, much, essentially, slightly, etc. may be viewed as an operator which acts on the fuzzy set representing the meaning of its operand.. Forexample, in the case of the composite term very tall man, the operator very actson the fuzzy meaning of the term tall man..   To represent a hedge as an operator, it is convenient to define severalelementary operations on fuzzy sets from which more complicated operations maybe built up by combination or composition.. In this way, an approximate representation for a hedge can be expressed in terms of such operations as complementation, intersection, concentration, dilation, contrastintensification, fuzzification, accentuation, etc..   Two categories of hedges are considered.. In the case of hedges of Type I, e.g., very, much, more or less, slightly, etc., the hedge can be approximatedby an operator acting on a single fuzzy set.. In the case of hedges of Type II, e.g., technically, essentially, practically, etc., the effect of the hedge is more  complicated, requiring a description of the manner in which the components of its operand are modified.. If, in addition, the characterization of a hedge requires a consideration of a metric or proximity relation in the space of its operand, then the hedge is said to be of Type IP or IIP, depending on whether itfalls into category I or II..   The approach is illustrated by constructing operator representations for several relatively simple hedges such as very, more or less, much, slightly,etc.. More complicated hedges whose effect is strongly context-dependent, require the use of a fuzzy-algorithmic mode of characterization which is more qualitative in nature than the approach described in the present paper..',\n",

It requires data on only the most productive journals, ismathematically simple and amenable to graphical methods if a proposed idea ofthe 'completeness' of a search is accepted.. For comparability of results, certain conditions, which include a specified minimum level of productivity of journals, need to be standardized.. A standard form is suggested..

He used the term to mean the illumination of theprocesses of science and technology by means of counting documents.

       "  \"  It is now ten years since some slight experimental evidence was presentedwhich appeared to support the hypothesis that there was an inverserelationship between recall and precision. The idea of this was certainly notnew; Fairthorne had more than implied it in his discussions on OBNA andABNO systems, i.e. Only-But-Not-All (high precision) and All-But-Not-Only (high recall).  However, it was one of the propositions arising fromCranfield I which met with strong opposition and was quite rightly attacked.In reply to the critical review by Swanson, I had to agree that thesimple hypothesis required modification.  By the following year test resultscoming from the experiments by Salton and from Cranfield II madefurther modification necessary, and the hypothesis was finally put forwardto read as follows: 'Within a single system, assuming that a sequence ofsubsearches for a particular question is made in the logical order of expecteddecreasing precision, and the requirements are those stated in the question,there is an inverse relationship between recall and precision, if the resultsof a number of different searches are averaged.  This, it will be noted, hasfour qualifications to the basic statement.\",\n",

       "  '   Many retrieval experiments are intended to discover ways of improving performance, taking the results obtained with some particular technique as a baseline.. The fact that substantial alterations to a system often have little or no effect on particular collections is puzzling.. This may be due to the initially poor separation of relevant and non-relevant documents..

It suggests parallel investigations into the structure of naturallanguage, with particular reference to terminology, as used in the differentbranches of basic science.  The criteria for defining the terminologicalconsistency of a subject are formulated and a measure suggested fordetermining the degree of terminological consistency.  The terminological and information structures of specific disciplines suchas, chemistry, physics, botany, zoology, and geology; the circumstances inwhich terms originate; and the efforts made by the international scientificcommunity to standardize the terminology in their respective disciplines -are examined in detail.  This investigation shows why and how an artificiallycreated scientific language finds it impossible to keep pace with currentdevelopments and thus points to the source of natural language.',\n",

       "  '   A classification is a theory of the structure of knowledge.. From a discussion of the nature of truth, it is held that scientific knowledge is the only knowledge which can be regarded as true.. The method of induction from empirical data is therefore applied to the construction of a classification..Items of knowledge are divided into uniquely definable terms, called isolates,and the relations between them, called operators.. It is shown that only fourbasic operators exist, expressing appurtenance, equivalence, reaction, andcausation; using symbols for these operators, all subjects can be analysed in alinear form called an analet.. With the addition of the permissible permutationsof such analets, formed according to simple rules, alphabetical arrangement of the first terms provides a complete, logical subject index.. Examples are given,and possible difficulties are considered.. A classification can then beconstructed by selection of deductive relations, arranged in hierarchical form..The nature of possible classifications is discussed.. It is claimed that such aninductively constructed classification is the only true representation of thestructure of knowledge, and that these principles provide a simple techniquefor accurately and fully indexing and classifying any given set of data, withcomplete flexibility..',\n",

       "  \"  It was first observed by Bradford that, for a large collection of journalreferences on a given subject, most of the articles are derived from a smallproportion of the total titles.  Bradford listed the journals concerned in orderof decreasing productivity and, by plotting the logarithms of the cumulativetotals of titles against the cumulative totals of relevant articles produced,he obtained a straight line.  (Similar results have been obtained by many laterworkers.  The pattern is illustrated by Table I which shows the distributionof references among journal titles obtained by the author during a study ofliterature usage in the petroleum industry.)  On the basis of these resultsBradford then formulated a simple mathematical model to describe referencescattering.  Vickery later pointed out that this 'law of scattering' predictednot a straight line but a curve.

       "  '   The foreign-language barrier facing British scientists is a function of a,the amount and value of foreign scientific literature produced; b, the linguistic ability of the people wishing to read it; and c, the availabilityand effectiveness of translation services.. To obtain quantitative data on these points the NLL has recently conducted a survey amongst scientists andlibrarians in the United Kingdom and the present paper presents the moreimportant results..   The survey has shown that the language problem is of considerable magnitudeand is common to the majority of scientists and technologists.. The languagescreating the most difficulty are Russian, German, and Japanese.. It has also indicated that local translation facilities are not particularly effective and that, as far as national facilities are concerned, British scientists are largely unaware of existing services which might help them to overcome their difficulties..   The results of the investigation suggest a number of lines of action which the appropriate authorities might follow..  The most important would seem to bethe publishing of a international index to translations and the creation within the United Kingdom of a centralized Japanese translation service..',\n",

This paper discussesthe variable of 'implicit use orientations' - the particular attitude taken bya subject (judge) about the intended use of a document.. One hundred and fortyjudges rated each of nine abstracts for relevance to several short information requirement statements.. The some judges then repeated the ratings, each adopting (assuming) one of the fourteen use orientations described to them.. Itwas found that the particular use orientation assumed by the judge has a marked effect on relevance judgements.. It was also found that implicit use orientations can be analysed in terms of their underlying structure and thattheir study offers the possibility of discovering the conditions under whichone person can accurately simulate and use the implicit use orientations of another..   Relevance judgements have been used as a basis of measures designed toevaluate the effectiveness of information retrieval system.. This judgementshave usually been accepted at face value and have not been subjected to critical scrutiny.. There is reason to believe, however, that as ordinarilyobtained, they may be unreliable and sensitive to a number of conditions ofmeasurement that have not been carefully controlled in previous evaluationstudies..\",\n",

The aim was to assess the effect, if any, of the considerable measures taken since the 1962 survey.. Uncontrolled factors, mainly related tothe rapid expansion of the University, may. however, have effected the results..It appears that, except for social science students, there were few improvementsin attitudes and use, and that seminars had little measurable effect.. Possible explanations for this are offered, and the place of reader services in a university library discussed..

       "  '   In a previous paper (J. Doc. 20 (4) 1964, 212-35) a series of tests onthe coverage, overlap, and indexing of abstracts journals were described.Briefly, these were carried out by selecting recent, comprehensivebibliographies on specific subjects, searching the appropriate abstractsjournals via the author indexes to determine the number of references givenin the bibliography that were abstracted, then consulting the subjectindexes to try to locate those references which are known to have been abstracted.  A further eight bibliographies have been studied, and theresults are reported here.   Our results are presented below in the following form:1. Title of bibliography, source, content (number of journal references,   reports, etc.).2. Abstracts journals consulted.3. Coverage and multiple coverage.  This is a bar-chart showing number of   references not abstracted, those covered once, twice, and so on.4. Coverage by each abstracts journal, given as a bar-chart, the last column   showing coverage by all services combined.  (Where bar-charts are given   they show coverages as percentages of the whole bibliography, actual   numbers of references being shown beneath the appropriate columns.5. Taking each abstracts journal separately, we show the headings under   which references were found in the subject index.  Some references we   were unable to locate, so there is often an apparent discrepancy with the   figures given in 4.',\n",

       "  '   A retrieval system may be evaluated strictly in terms of user satisfaction(operating efficiency), or it may be evaluated from the point of view ofefficient means of satisfying user requirements (economic efficiency).. Whenwe consider the relationship between operating efficiency and economic efficiency, we are faced with a whole series of possible trade-offs.. Theremay be several alternative paths we can follow in order to serve user needs..The problem is to determine the most economical path to follow.. Pay-offfactors, break-even points, and diminishing returns must be taken into consideration.. This paper considers some of these factors in relation to variousparts of the complete retrieval system: the acquisition subsystem, the indexing subsystem, the index language, the searching subsystem, and the equipment subsystem..',\n",

       "  \"  I would suggest three possible reasons for the constant average number ofreferences per article.  Firstly, on average, articles more than fifteen yearsold rarely get cited as they are rendered obsolete by the rate of advance.  Thenet increase per annum of 'citeable articles' is not as large as might otherwisebe expected.  Secondly many relatively small specialized subject areas, each tending tohave its own literature and 'internal' citation practices, are hiving off fromthe classical areas, because of the specialized nature of modern science.  Thirdly it seems that the 'building blocks' of an article can on averagebe adequately specified (regardless of the volume of published information)by reference to about eleven items of the prior art relating to the maintheme, associated concepts and methods, and general background.\",\n",

       "  \"   Some parameters and techniques in use for describing the results of tests on IR systems are analysed.. Several considerations outside the score of the usual 2x2 table are relevant to the choice of parameters.. In particular, avariable which produces a 'performance curve' of a system corresponds to anextension of the 2x2 table.. Also, the statistical relationships betweenparameters are all-important.. It is considered that precision is not such auseful measure of performance (in conjunction with recall) as fallout..

       "  \"   The paper presents the results of a survey of the use of social science periodicals carried out at the National Lending Library during a period of four weeks in 1968..   Three-quarters of the requests came from universities and industrial organizations and over 90% of the requests were for English language publications.. Over a fifth of the requests were for seventeen titles.. Therewere marked variations in the subject matter requested by different types oforganizations and although the overall 'half-life' of the literature proved tobe 3 1/2 years this figure varied considerably from one subject to another..   Concerning the sources of references, it was discovered that compared withscientists and technologists social scientists make relatively little use ofabstracting and indexing publications..   Appendixes include a copy of the questionnaire used in the survey, a list oftitle requested six or more times, and a list of abstracting and indexing publications cited five or more times as sources of references..\",\n",

       "  \"  Since 1960, and especially during the past three years, many papers haveappeared about particular manifestations and applications of a certain classof empirical laws to a field that may be labelled conveniently 'Bibliometrics'.This term, resuscitated by Alan Pritchard (see page 348), denotes,in my paraphrase, quantitative treatment of the properties of recordeddiscourse and behaviour appertaining to it.  In this field the law cited is usually that named after Bradford orZipf according to whether the interest is in vocabulary or periodicalliterature or physical access, in the rate of diminishing returns, or in thecumulative yield from a given input.  The behaviour is hyperbolic; that is,the product of fixed powers of the variables is constant.  This type ofbehaviour has been observed for a century or so in fields ranging frommeteorology to economics, and has given rise to many particular explanationsappropriate to the particular fields.  Thus it has received many names according to its exponents, in both senses of that word.\",\n",

       "  '   Evidence provided by the Dainton Report indicates that special libraries inthe UK are far from fully exploiting the photocopying services provided by thenational libraries.. As these photocopying services are legally obliged to operate at cost, they offer significant economies to any special library which exploits them systematically..   This paper describes a simple graphical method of estimating the savings that can be made, or the extended subject coverage that can be obtained at noadditional cost, by substituting photocopies for relevant papers in the peripheral periodicals relating to any well-defined scientific or technicalsubject..

       "  \"  The expression 'half-life', borrowed from physics, has appearedquite frequently in the literature on documentation since 1960, when anarticle by Burton and Kebler on The 'half-life' of some scientific and technicalliteratures was published, although it had certainly been used previously.Burton and Kebler point out that literature becomes obsolescent rather thandisintegrating (as in its original meaning), so that 'half-life' means 'half theactive life', and this is commonly understood as meaning the time duringwhich one-half of the currently active literature was published.  Numerousstudies have been carried out, mainly by the analysis of citations, to establishobsolescence rates of the literature of different subjects.  Bourne points outthat different studies have given widely different results, so that many of the'half-life' figures reported are not valid beyond the particular sample ofliterature or users surveyed; certainly they cannot be used as accuratemeasures for discriminating between different subject-fields.\",\n",

       "  \"  Thirty years or more ago, a favoured question in examination papersfor librarians was some variation on the theme 'Compare the merits of aclassified catalogue and an alphabetical subject catalogue'.  This was asubject which it was possible to write on or to discuss at great length,advancing a number of theoretical arguments or opinions expressed by pundits,without ever stating a single demonstratable fact.  When, in the early 1950's,various people, such as Taube and Mooers, proposed new techniques forindexing, the reaction from the traditionally-minded was such that itappeared there was to be a repetition of all the old arguments.  In aneditorial in American Documentation in 1955, Perry expressed a viewpoint,shared by many others, when he wrote:     Cautious and searching evaluation of all experimental results is    essential in rating the efficiency of documentation systems.  May    the age-old controversies that arose from the conventional concepts    of classification not be reborn in the mechanized searching systems    of the future.  There is hope for the avoidance of such errors if    we will but regard documentation systems as useful devices, the    benefits of which must be determined, not by polemics, but by the    intelligent measurement of such benefits in relation to needs and    costs.  The machines of the future can make us free, but only if we    are willing to subject them, and ourselves, to the most rigid    intellectual discipline.\",\n",

       "  \"  Classification is so fundamental and pervasive an activity that careis needed to define its scope when discussing a particular application, suchas information retrieval.  Retrieval from an information store (a 'library') of those items relevantto a request involves locating a particular class (describing what we thinkwe want) and then, if necessary, adjusting this class - broadening it to findmore material or narrowing it if the initial response proves excessive.  Thisimplies recognition of the relations between the classes, and the wholeoperation is often referred to neatly as 'locating and relating'.  Assumingthat we examine only a limited set of documents (those most likely to berelevant) the operation is entirely one of classification - the recognition ofparticular classes and their relations.

       "  \"   A description is given of the English Electric 'Thesaurofacet', a faceted classification and thesaurus covering engineering and related scientific, technical, and management subjects.. A novel feature of the system is the integration of the classification schedules and thesaurus.. Each term appearsboth in the thesaurus and in the schedules.. In the schedules the term isdisplayed in the most appropriate facet and hierarchy: the thesaurus supplements this information by indicating alternative hierarchies and other relationships which cut across the classified arrangement.. The thesaurus also controls word forms and synonyms and acts as the alphabetical index to the class numbers.. The resulting tool is multipurpose, as easily applicable to shelf arrangement and conventional classified card catalogues as to co-ordinate indexing andcomputerized retrieval systems.. The reasons are given for modifying certaintraditional facet techniques, including the choice of traditional disciplinesfor main classes, the lack of a 'built-in' preferred order, and the use, in certain instances, of enumeration rather than synthesis to express multi-termconcepts.. Methods of application of the Thesaurofacet in pre-coordinate andpost-coordinate systems are discussed and brief account is given of the techniques employed in its compilation..\",\n",

       "  \"  The term 'informatics' was first advanced formally by the Directorof Viniti, A.I. Mikhailov, and his colleagues A.I. Chernyi and R.S.Gilyarevskii, in their paper Informatics - new name for the theory of ScientificInformation published at the end of 1966.  An English translation wascircularized in the beginning of 1967.  As the authors state in this paper,they are not the first to use this term, and they quote a review by ProfessorJ.G. Dorfmann of their own book Fundamentals of Scientific Information inwhich Dorfmann criticizes the use of other terminology, such as 'documentation','documentalistics', 'information science', and so on.  Their definition is as stated above but they are careful to add the rider that Informatics does not investigate the specific content of scientific information,only the structure and properties.  In their paper they also advance definitionsfor 'information', 'scientific information', 'scientific information activity','information officer', and 'information scientist'.  They have backed up theirproposal by changing the title of their own book for its second edition, andthe title of the information science fascicule of the Referativnyi Zhurnal,which is now called Informatiki.\",\n",

       "  '   One technique for searching a Co-ordinate Index is to compare each referencewith a Boolean expression of index terms.. This divides the file into retrievedand not-retrieved references.. An alternative is to assign each reference scorecalculated from its index terms and to retrieve the N highest scoring references in the file.. This scoring technique has several advantages intheory, and it performed slightly better in a retrieval test with N equal tothe number of references retrieved by the corresponding Boolean search.. In thetest a minimum value of N = 10 was used, and when less then this number ofreferences matched the Boolean search requirement, the Scoring techniquesuccessfully widened the score of the search and retrieved twice as many relevant references as the Boolean searches..',\n",

       "  '   This paper is concerned with the availability of books known to be held by the Library.. It outlines a simple survey method whereby readers record the non-availability of books which they are looking for.. The survey has alreadybeen installed at four university libraries, but the results from only one library are considered here.. These results show how a librarian can find outthe degree of non-availability or failure in any particular area of the library,the causes of failure, and even the particular items which are in heavy demandand not available..   They also provide information on the degree of co-operation by the readers, the number of titles failing once, twice, three times etc., the overlap of demand for popular books by different groups of borrowers, the waiting time for books that failed, the pattern of demand for particular books over a period of time, the relationship between failure and recall, the correlation of failure from one term to the next, and the relative use of books inside and outside the library..   From the results it was possible to recommend certain changes in library procedure which should have reduced failure, and to compare the titles of booksfailing in the Main Library with the holdings of a departmental library..

       "  '   The exhaustivity of document descriptions and the specificity of index termsare usually regarded as independent.. It is suggested that specificity should beinterpreted statistically, as a function of term use rather than of term meaning.. The effect on retrieval of variations in term specificity are examined, experiments with three test collections showing in particular thatfrequently-occurring terms are required for good overall performance.. It isargued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency, so that matches on less frequent, more specific, terms are of greater value than matcheson frequent terms.. Results for the test collections show that considerable improvements in performance are obtained with this very simple procedure..',\n",

The cost of the data base to subscribers is a known quantity, and the coverage is decided by the database producers..   This paper describes an investigation into the relative performance of thefour major Chemical Abstracts Service magnetic tape data-base, Chemical Titles (CT), which contains the titles of citations only, Chemical Abstracts Condensates (CAC), which contains titles enriched with keyword phrases,Chemical-Biological Activities (CBAC),and Polymer Science and Technology (POST),both of which contain full digests in addition to titles..   The performance was measured in terms of the relative currency of the fourdata-bases, on the retrieval efficiency of profiles searched against them.. Fifty questions from industrial and government research organizations were used in the experiment.. Search profiles corresponding to these questions wereconstructed for searching against each database, output was assessed for relevance by users, and profile performance figures (precision and recall ratios) were calculated for each profile..

       "  \"   This paper continues the reporting of the Unit's work on a method of investigating how often readers fail to find what they are looking for on the shelves, why they fail, and what particular books they fail to find..   The method used is a slight modification of the earlier one - readers wereasked to record on a slip provided the details of the book or periodical theywere looking for, or subject area they were looking in, their academic status,and the date, and then to place the slip in an adjoining box.. Fron analysis ofthese 'failure' slips it was possible to determine the cause of the reader'sfailure, the individual book the reader was looking for, and the pattern offailure for different groups of volumes..  A new development was surveys of samples of readers, carried out during thefortnight of peak demand.. Answers to these surveys provided information on theeffect or failure on a reader's work, what action he took after failing, whetherhe found adequate substitutes, how many books he found by browsing, and whatproportion of the books he consulted he borrowed.. Some of these answers could bechecked by a direct count of the books used in, and borrowed from, the library..   The investigations were carried out in three University libraries, each with its own characteristic library structure and teaching patterns.. These differences were reflected in the results obtained..

We could define the latter without reference to the usual distinction between 'scientificliterature' (the object of document analysis in information science) and otherkinds of texts - historical records, myths, folklore, sacred writings, etc.)..Indeed, one of my theses in that there is little hope of understanding the kind of intellectual operations involved in the analysis of scientific documents, orquestions pertaining to them other than through a study of textual analysis in general, as carried out in many disciplines - history, sociology, culturalanthropology, exegesis. etc. (Gardin, 1969)..

The performance of the mechanized SDI service has been compared with that ofthe pre-existing current awareness service which is based on visual scanning ofjournals and reports by information staff.. The visual service was found to beproviding an important service of good currency and high precision, about 85%, to a limited number of users.. the mechanized service is less selective and of lower precision, approximately 50%, but can be expanded more readily..   In order to compare the effectiveness of Euratom index terms and words on titles for computer SDI matching, an experiment was set up in which sixty users of the mechanized service assessed NSA document notifications which were generated by matching either index terms and subject categories, or words in titles and subject categories, without being aware of the method of matching.. Over 10,000 document assessments, fron six issues of NSA were returned.. The average precision was 45.6% for index terms and 47.3% for title words.. Index terms retrieved more documents, in the ratio 1.13:1, but both systems missed many relevant documents retrieved by the other.. Index terms retrieved only 58% of the relevant documents selected by titles.. The converse ratio was 51%..   No significant effects of document types or subject on the relative effectiveness of two matching systems were found, but when the results were analyzed by title length it appeared that for titles longer than about 100 characters title words gave recall equal to that of index terms, though with a lower precision..

       "  \"   The ideas and techniques of physics have been systematically applied to thestudy of living matter since the 1950s and 1960s.. As a result a rapid and large increase has taken place in the research activity in this field and biophysics and molecular biology have emerged as important areas of study.. Theconsequent enormous growth of literature  in the field has created great difficulties in tracking out the significant literature of the subject.. To cope with this unprecedented growth of literature, a ranking list of periodicalsin this field has been prepared on the basis of citations in the Annual review of biochemistry for 1968, 1969, and 1970.. This list is expected to reflect the impact of literature on the progress of biochemical knowledge more accurately than the list prepared by Henkle in 1938.. The present list brings out the predominant position of biochemical research in the total scientific effort today, and the increasing bias of cognate disciplines towards biochemicalmethodologies.. A method of analysis of the number of citations in relation to size of the journal concerned and average length of the papers published has beendeveloped and applied in this study.. The analysis yields three parameters which should be useful in assessing the actual scientific interest of a journal in relation to the number of paper published, compactness of the information content, and the scientific value of the paper in relation to compactness of presentation..   The results of the present study have been discussed in relation to Bradford's Law of Scattering and an extension of the Law has been suggested, namely, that during phases of rapid and vigorous growth of knowledge in a scientific disciplines, articles of interest to that discipline appear in increasing numbers in periodicals distant from that field.. It is expected that the present ranking list will enable librarians and other professional workers in the field of biochemistry to select journals from the viewpoint of their significance to the active areas or present day biochemical research..\",\n",

       "  '   In the course of the survey covered by this paper, cost data were collectedby visiting eighteen operational computer-based systems in Europe and the USA,using a structured cost analysis scheme.. The sample included data-base producers and self-contained systems that both create, and provide services from, a data base..   From the data obtained, unit costs have been derived for most operations, and the factors contributing to variations in the figures are discussed..   Analysis of the data has shown that costs are affected more significantly by factors such as system management, salary variations, and productivity of staff,than by technical factors such as depth of indexing, data preparation methods, or computer programming..

       "  '  The literature of the last few decades reflects a steadily increasingconcern with quantitative assessment of libraries and their services.  Thisconcern is both the result of, and a reaction to, growing pressures fromwithin and without the library profession to adopt the tools of themanagement sciences.  The pressures are generated by many factors includingthe success of these tools in other fields and their adoption by theorganizations supporting libraries, the increasingly explicit characterof competition for funds at all levels, and the complexity and criticalnature of decisions on the host of new options being created by technologyand by formalization of library networks.',\n",

       "  '  Before starting to trace the development of PRECIS to itstheoretical beginnings I shall describe the system briefly in its presentform.  This will serve not only as an introduction for those who are notfamiliar with the system, but will also help to explain the relevance ofsome of the historical sections which follow, in which we shall see how amachine-produced alphabetical indexing system, based on a syntax derivedfrom a study of natural language, developed out of research into principles for a new general classification.  PRECIS, or the PREserved Context Indexing System, differs in somerespects from traditional alphabetical indexes and lists of subject headings.Like the system developed by Coates for the British Technology Index,PRECIS consists essentially of a set of working procedures, not a prescribedlist of terms or phrases.  The system is firmly based upon the concept of anopen-ended vocabulary, which means that terms can be admitted into theindex at any time, as soon as they have been encountered in literature.Once a term has been admitted, its relationships with other terms arehandled in two different ways, distinguished as the syntactical and thesemantic sides of the system.',\n",

       "  \"  While Fairthorne may not have been the first person to recognize it,certainly, for this author, Fairthorne was the first to make explicit thefundamental problems of information retrieval systems, namely the clashbetween OBNA and ABNO (Only-But-Not-All and All-But-Not-Only).Although it was not until 1958 that the terms occur in Fairthorne'swritings, the concept had been discussed in many meetings of the AGARDDocumentation Panel and elsewhere.  Originally it was considered that to meetthese two requirements, it might be necessary to have two separate systems,and the test of the UNITERM system in 1954 was based on the hypothesisthat a 'Marshalling' system (e.g. U.D.C.) was fundamentally different froma 'Retrieval' system (e.g. UNITERM).  While the idea persisted in this formfor some time, it gradually evolved into the inverse relationship of recalland precision, which is to say that while it is possible to obtain, of therelevant documents, All-But-Not-Only, or alternatively to obtain Only-But-Not-All, it is not possible to obtain All and Only.\",\n",

There is little evidence of a reduction in journal circulationfigures.. In spite of large increases in journal prices (which have risen muchfaster, in terms of cost per page, than the Retail Price Index), universitylibraries have, since the NLLST was established, devoted an increasingly high proportion of their budgets to journals, though recent financial pressures are now forcing cancellation.. An extensive survey of demand for journals at BLLD shows a heavy concentration on a relatively small number of titles, most of them well established journals, widely held by libraries and with large circulations.. The demand for in-print issues of the average journal is small..It is concluded, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that economicdifficulties experienced by journals publishers and the increased demand on the BLLD are unrelated, though both owe something to the economic pressures on libraries..',\n",

This leads to problems of:   (a) currency: keeping the scheme in line with new discoveries..   (b) hospitality: allowing room for insertion of new subjects..   (c) cross-classification: a concept may be considered in such a way that it        fits as logically into one discipline as another..   Machine retrieval is also hampered by the fact that any individual concept isnotated differently, depending on where in the scheme it appears..   The approach now considered is from an organized universe of concepts, every concept being set down only once in an appropriate vocabulary, where it acquiresthe notation which identifies it wherever it is used.. It has been found thatall the concepts present in any compound subject can be handled as though theybelong to one of two basic concept types, using either Entitles or Attributes..In classing, these concepts are identified, and notation is selected fromappropriate schedules.. Subjects are then built according to formal rules, thefinal class number incorporating operators which convey the fundamental relationships between concepts..   Fron this viewpoint, the Rules and Operators of the proposed system can be seen as the grammar of an IR language, and the schedules of Entitles and Attributes as its vocabulary..',\n",

       "  '   The kinds of information needed by managing librarians to make correct decisions are considered, with emphasis on the value of current data on the exceptional situation.. Management information in a library is of greatest use in comparison, either internally, or with data from other libraries.. A simple,standard method of recording and costing is urged, so that librarians may readily identify procedures requiring improvement..   Development of the present costing method is traced from its original stateas a simple management information system based on exception reporting (i.e.reporting the exceptions which occur in any particular survey), through a pilot study in a large university library, to its full installation in two further university libraries.. The method of analyzing the raw data is described, andexamples of the tables are given, together with brief background information on the libraries concerned..   After a note on the limitations of the present costing method and of unit costs in general, unit times and costs are given for numerous operations in both the libraries surveyed, covering both reader and technical services.. Thereis agreement between results of several American studies and those of the present investigation.. For further comparison, the information on times andsalaries has been used in conjunction with a standard civil service costingprocedure..',\n",
